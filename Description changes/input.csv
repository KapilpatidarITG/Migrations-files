come-to-the-new-site,"Hi, I'm Chris, and I want to welcome you to our new site!  We're really excited to launch, and we're hoping you're excited to check it out.



So what's new?



We've had two different sites for a while now, namely shinodadesigncenter.net and shinodasales.com.  We really wanted to put everything together for our customers, so that they could find information AND products all in the same place.  Now you can browse some of our selection (and our online catalog is growing steadily) while also reading new informational posts and seeing pictures from our shows or around the store.  We have a lot more planned for the new site, but that'll be a surprise for you when we debut it :)



What's still the same?



We're still <strong>wholesale only</strong>, business-to-business.  That's very important to us.  To see pricing information and availability, you'll have to be a member.  To become a member of the new site, you have to be an existing member of one of our Shinoda Design Center stores, or you'll need to become a member (which you can find more about on our <a href=""http://shinodasales.com/faq"">FAQ</a>).  While the new site might look a bit like some other retail sites you may have seen or used, we are still dedicated to our business customers and will only be serving them.



I can't say enough how excited we are about the new site.  It marks a new chapter in the long history of Shinoda Design Center.  So take a look around.  For now, treat the new site like a catalog of both products and information.  If you have questions about something you see here, you can <a href=""http://shinodasales.com/contact"">contact</a> us via e-mail, or call your local store.



You'll be hearing more from me, James, Catherine, Stacey, and some of the other Shinoda employees as the site grows up.  We hope to hear plenty from you as well.

shinoda-design-center-tour,"Here's some pictures from around the Santa Ana store we took recently.  The store tour was one of the most popular features on the old site.  I think that speaks to how much fun it is to wander through our stores.  So here's a virtual walk through the place.  Enjoy!

shinoda-design-center-americana-coupon,"Memorial Day is swiftly approaching, and it's bringing the unofficial start of summer with it (who wants to wait until the middle of June?).  But it's not just a holiday to mark the beginning of summer.  Memorial Day started as a holiday called ""Decoration Day"" in the middle 1800s.  It was a day set aside to decorate the graves of fallen US soldiers and pay tribute to the sacrifices they had made.  After World War II, it became more commonly known as Memorial Day, and in 1968 it was officially moved to the last Monday in May, making it a Federal holiday.  At the same time, Memorial Day is a festive and solemn occasion, which I think makes it a very interesting and important day.



About one month after Memorial Day comes the Fourth of July, a summer celebration of the declaration of US independence from England.  So there's definitely a lot of patriotism and Americana in the air for the next couple months.  That's why we're having a sale on Americana at Shinoda's!

<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Shinoda-Design-Center-Americana-Red-White-Blue.jpg""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Shinoda-Design-Center-Americana-Red-White-Blue-1024x682.jpg"" alt=""Shinoda Design Center Americana Red White Blue"" title=""Shinoda Design Center Americana Red White Blue"" width=""640"" height=""426"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-412"" /></a>



Your clients and customers will be in a patriotic mood this summer, so bring this coupon in between 5/16/2011 and 5/21/2011 for 25% off the each price of any of our Americana items to stock up.  For an item to qualify, it must have all 3 colors, red, white and blue, just like the images in Tom's picture up there, and unfortunately, ribbon is not included in the sale.  Don't forget to print out the coupon, and I hope to see you around the store.

white-silk-flowers-in-store-coupon-for-52311-52811,"Great coupon this week: 25% off our white silk flower stems.  White silks come in handy for any event or setting and are essential for any summer wedding you may be planning.  So now's the time to come in and stock up.  Here's a sample of some of our selection, taken by Tom as usual (although I'm not sure where he took this one).



[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""700"" caption=""Where did Tom take this picture?""]<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/images/promos/2011/May/White-Silk-Flowers-Shinoda-Design-Center.jpg""><img title=""White Silk Flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/images/promos/2011/May/White-Silk-Flowers-Shinoda-Design-Center.jpg"" alt=""White Silk Flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""700"" height=""467"" /></a>[/caption]



I'm colorblind, so I'm probably the last person you should be taking color-based design advice from (or letting design the color scheme for your website for that matter).  As such, I've always gravitated towards blacks and whites.  It's always striking and always simple.



This week, we'll provide the white.  Click the picture below for a printable version of the coupon.  Print it out and bring it in for 25% off the each price of any of our white silk flower stems (sorry, no potted silk flowers or pre-made custom arrangements).  Hope to see you around the store!

whats-new-on-the-site,"Hi Everyone!



I wanted to take a break from ... well, breaking things on the web page to tell you about what's new.  We've finally gotten things going pretty smoothly now, so we can start adding cool features, which is really nice.  But all of this craziness has given me a real appreciation for the kinds of torment you guys deal with on a daily basis.  When you're creating something that other people are going to see, use, appreciate, etc., you always want to do your best.  Sometimes, on the way to doing your best, you take a few wrong turns (like deleting ALL of your webpages like I did 2 Fridays ago).  For you, maybe you realize you accidentally bought the wrong flowers, used the wrong colors, or just misunderstood what your client asked for.  Your stomach drops, your heart sinks, and you generally feel pretty lousy.  As bad as that feels, it feels just as good when you work hard and make it right.  So if you see me around the store and want to commiserate about projects gone wrong, I'd love to hear.



Back to the real reason for this post.  I just wanted to talk about some of the new features on the site.  I'd like to make this a regular feature so you can make the most of our new page.  If you have any suggestions for features you'd like to see, please leave a comment!

<ul>

	<li>James spent a few afternoons transferring all of our picture galleries over.  I can't explain to you how mind-numbingly difficult that was.  A few times I looked over at him just to make sure he hadn't fallen asleep.  For each picture you see up there, James looked at it, wrote a description, wrote a title, and gave it a nice name.  Not bad when you do one picture, and it's OK if you just do one gallery.  He was doing about 3-4 a day for a few days, with a total of 15 galleries.  You can see all of his hard work at our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/tag/gallery/"">Shinoda Design Center Gallery</a> page. Thanks James!</li>

<li>I just have to say, 'my bad' about the first week or so of registrations.  I thought one thing, and the website clearly thought another.  After receiving a ton of e-mails expressing confusion about the registration process, I realized that I must not have explained things very well, and also I had assumed something about the login process that wasn't true.  We've now added a couple sections to the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/faq"">FAQ</a> that better explain the registration and activation process.  If you have questions about getting your account activated, check the FAQ first, and if you can't find a satisfactory answer, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/contact"">contact us</a> and we'll help you out.</li>

[caption id=""attachment_575"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""606"" caption=""Sorry!""]<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/faq#accountactivation""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Shinoda-Design-Center-FAQ-Activation.jpg"" alt=""Shinoda Design Center FAQ Activation"" title=""Shinoda Design Center FAQ Activation"" width=""606"" height=""211"" class=""size-full wp-image-575"" /></a>[/caption]

	<li>Our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/vase"">search feature</a> has been greatly improved.  Results should be sorted by relevance now, along with the matching categories that were displayed before.  In addition, you can search for any result by entering http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/your-item/.  If you have a multi-word search, use a - to separate the words like I just did.  So if you want to see anything that matches the word, 'vase', <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/vase"">http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/vase</a>.  White vases? <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/white-vase/"">http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/white-vase/</a>.  Of course you can always use the search bar on any page as well.  If you're having trouble finding your item in search, you can try a couple things.  Always search for singular search words instead of plurals, like white vase instead of white vases.  If you know a UPC number for your product, you can enter that in the search bar as well and you should be taken right to what you're looking for.  The last tip is to be less specific if you're having trouble.  So if 'white vase' isn't working, try 'vase' and see if you can find any white ones (by the way, I keep using 'vase' as an example because it's the most searched for term on the site).</li>

[caption id=""attachment_576"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""267"" caption=""Search: Now with working magnifying glass!""]<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/vase""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Shinoda-Design-Center-Search.jpg"" alt=""Shinoda Design Center Search"" title=""Shinoda Design Center Search"" width=""267"" height=""39"" class=""size-full wp-image-576"" /></a>[/caption]</ul>



We have a couple other smaller upgrades, like the return of our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sdc-theme/sdc-zoom.php?pid=2762"">product zoom</a>, a link to our weekly promo at the top, and some controls on the front page rotating image.  You can also see all of our new products on the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/new"">new product page</a>.



Phew.  Hope you're enjoying the page, and like I said before, let us know if you have a suggestion for a feature you'd like to see added (or in the very highly unlikely situation that you find something that doesn't work, you can let us know about that too).  We want this to be a resource for you, so we'd like to hear from you on how to make it better.



See you around the store,

Chris

birds-bugs-butterflies,"This week, we're ushering in summer with some memorable signs of summer: birds, bugs, and butterflies.  I'm from Pennsylvania, and we knew it was summer when we'd see lightning bugs.  That and the temperature got to 100 degrees and 100% humidity.  But it was always very exciting to see the first lightning bugs and know that summer was here.  Moving out here was quite a different experience.  We discovered a hummingbird living in our backyard in the middle of January, which was a strange sight to see for an east coaster like myself.

That picture gives you an idea of why we specifically mention 'butterflies' in our coupon.  Sure, they're also bugs, but we have a large selection of butterflies, so they merit some special attention.  In fact, our online store has an entire category devoted to them: <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/birds-animals-insects/butterflies/"">Butterflies</a>.  We also have categories for <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/birds-animals-insects/insects/"">bugs</a> and <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/birds-animals-insects/birds/"">birds</a>.



The coupon can also be used on birdhouses, cages, and nests, and of course, we have our own category of those on the online store too: <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/birds-animals-insects/birdhouses-nests/"">Birdhouses, cages, and nests</a>.  So click on the coupon below to view a printable copy, and don't forget to bring it with you when you come to the store!  You'll get 25% off of birds, bugs, butterflies, birdhouses, bird cages, and nests (not applicable to ribbon).  Thanks for shopping at Shinoda's!

It's time to stock up for summer.  Summer means weddings, reunions, weddings, barbecues, weddings, pool parties, and weddings.  Whether you're planning the event or providing the flowers, you'll need plenty.  You can plan ahead by checking out some of our selection on our website under the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/silk-flower-stems/"">silk flower stems</a> category.



To celebrate this month of sales, we'll be writing about some of our stems.  So why are we telling you guys, some of whom work with flowers every day, <em>more</em> about flowers?  Well, the first reason is kind of selfish.  Unlike the Shinoda family, I'm not from the flower world.  Since I work at Shinoda Design Center, I really need to know my stems, and right now, I don't.  Sometimes when I'm walking the floor to think about something on the site, a customer will ask me a question about an event or want some flower advice.  Usually after saying something like, 'um' or 'uh' or desperately looking for one of our more knowledgeable employees, I ask for a minute to find someone who can help.  I'd really like to be more helpful in that situation.



Also, as someone who's worked a long time with computers, there's still a lot that I don't know.  Basically every day I learn something useful.  Sometimes I learn about a whole topic that I had never heard about before.  For the next 30 days, we'll be doing some digging to find out tidbits about some of our flowers that you may not have known.  Hopefully you can learn something new or be reminded of something you had forgotten.  Check in every day at our <a href=""/silk-flower-stem-of-the-day"">Silk Flower Stem of the day</a> for something new each day.

anemone-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"<div itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Product"">

My first pick for flower of the day is the anemone.  Why?  Two reasons.  First, I've never heard of anemones, except the sea kind.  Since we don't sell any sea creatures here, anemone flowers must be something different (although the sea anemone is named after the flower anemone).  The other reason for researching anemones first is that I always used our anemone products to test the website.  Anemones were easy to click on from the store menu, so I ended up testing them frequently.  I figure I owe it to them for being helpful to me.



It's believed that the name <em>anemone</em> comes from Greek and means, 'daughter of the wind'.  In Greek mythology, anemones sprang from the blood of Adonis upon his death.  When he died, Aphrodite spread nectar over Adonis's blood, and voila, Anemone.  Leave it to mythology to give a morbid explanation for a beautiful flower.  Some doubt that anemone actually means daughter of the wind and contend that it's merely a corruption of the root of Adonis's Semitic name, Adonai.

[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""You can thank Adonis for these""]<a itemprop=""url"" href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/23-anemone-spray-x3-red/2760/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Silk Flower Anemones at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/3/3/3384912118.jpg"" title=""Silk Flower Anemone wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



I'll leave that for someone else to figure out.  Whatever dispute exists over the name, we do know some things for sure.  There are approximately 120 varieties (or species) of the anemone genus, and you can find them in Europe, North America, and Japan.  Different species of anemones will flower in the spring, summer, and fall, and are most commonly shades of red, blue, or purple in color.  Wikipedia describes the coloring as 'crimson, scarlet, blue, purple and white,' which to a colorblind person means, 'red, blue, and white'.



I believe our anemones are the <em>Anemone coronaria</em> or 'poppy anemone'.  When reading about poppy anemones, I discovered yet another possible name origin.  This one seemed pretty convincing, so I'll fill you in.  The Sumerian god of food and vegetation was named Tammuz.  Why is that important?  Because it's generally believed that the Greeks adopted the story of Tammuz as the story of Adonis.  Tammuz was known to Phoenicians as 'Nea'man', and it's from that name where anemone originates.  Poppy anemones grow wild in some of the oldest parts of the civilized world, so I'll give the nod to the oldest story.



Phew.  That was a lot more Sumerian and Phoenician research than I thought I was going to do today.  Hope you enjoyed learning a little something more about anemones.  And thanks to <a href=""http://www.wikipedia.org"">wikipedia</a> for helping me learn about anemones.

Today's Silk Flower Stem of the Day is the <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/peony/"">Peony</a>.  According to the John Henry Fresh Floral Fan Deck, fresh peonies are just about at the end of their availability, which goes from March to June (of course silk peonies are always in season :) ).

As you can see from our stems above, peonies come in a variety of colors, namely white, pink, magenta, red, burgundy, peach, and yellow.  In addition to many colors, the peony can also convey many meanings.  It can suggest healing or good health and a happy life.  At the same time, it can also represent anger and indignation, which makes the peony a pretty conflicted flower if you ask me.  Peonies can also represent a happy marriage, and are associated with a 12th wedding anniversary.



We once again travel back to ancient Greece for the name of the peony.  Peonies are named after Paeon, who was a student of the Greek god of healing and medicine, Asclepius.  That inspires the associations with healing and good health.  Unfortunately for Paeon, he was not so lucky.  Asclepius became very jealous of him, and in a last ditch effort to save Paeon, Zeus turned him into a peony.  Good for us; not as good for Paeon.



So peonies have been at the source of conflict from the start.  One thing that is pretty easy to agree on is that the peony is a very beautiful flower, and works well by itself or with others.  They'd be a great addition to a wedding, and the bride would be delighted to know that it's a symbol of a happy marriage.



Just don't tell her the stuff about Paeon.

Today's stem is one that I've always associated with summer and my mom's garden: the <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/sunflowers/"">sunflower</a>.  Each year, my mom would plant some sunflowers and give custody of one to me and one to my brother.  Naturally, this became a contest to see whose could grow taller, as most things between me and my brother became.  Every year at some point the sunflowers would become much taller than the two of us, so it would be hard to figure out who was winning, which spawned more arguing.  In my mom's defense, if she hadn't given us the sunflowers, we probably would have been arguing over something else, so at least this way the garden looked nice.



[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""Summertime means sunflowers ... and arguing about them""]<a itemprop=""url"" href=""/51-giant-sunflower-yellow/9100/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Sunflowers at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/3/4390191741.jpg"" title=""Sunflower wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



I didn't realize it until I read it in <em>Botanica</em>, but sunflowers are a genus of the <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/daisy/"">daisy</a> family.  The heads of daisies and sunflowers both have ray florets that extend outward and form the petals, and many disc florets, which comprise the middle.  It's the disc florets in the middle that grow to become the tasty seeds.  A floret is really just a small flower, so that means that sunflowers and daisies are composed of many flowers, which is why they're called <em>composite</em> flowers.



<em>Helianthus annuus</em>, the formal name for the common sunflower, is a member of the <em>helianthus</em> genus.  Helia, meaning sun, and anthus, meaning flower, gives us the name <em>sunflower</em>.  Sunflowers need a lot of sun, and young sunflowers will actually track the sun as it moves across the sky, hence the name.  Older sunflowers, more set in their ways, will just face east.  And no, there does not seem to be a Greek hero who died and made a sunflower, or who was transformed into a sunflower, or who was named Sunflower, or anything like that.  Sunflowers seem to have a pretty peaceful back story.



Unless you ask me and my brother.

magnolia-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"<div itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Product"">

I think the best way to describe today's silk flower stem of the day is old.  Old probably does not even do it justice, as there is evidence of <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/silk-flower-stems/magnolias/"">magnolia</a> relatives as far back as 95 million years ago.  It's hard to really understand how long ago that was, so here are some things that magnolias are older than:

<ul>

	<li>Tyrannosaurs Rex</li>

	<li>Ice Age</li>

	<li>Bees</li>

</ul>



[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""If you&#039;re older than bees, you&#039;re old""]<a itemprop=""url"" href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/26-de-decor-magnolia-stem-x1/6920/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Magnolias at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/3/1/3193728725.jpg"" title=""Magnolia wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



When the Tyrannosaurus Rex showed up around 68 million years ago and started terrorizing children at amusement parks, magnolias had already been around for 30 MILLION years!  And since there were no bees around to pollinate them, they had to count on beetles for pollination.  Beetles are a bit bigger and rowdier than bees, so magnolia flowers are a little more sturdy than others.



Magnolias grow on deciduous and evergreen trees, and come in over 100 varieties.  I believe the magnolia that most people are familiar with is <em>magnolia grandiflora</em>, also known as the Southern Magnolia.  It's the official state flower of Louisiana and Mississippi, although Mississippi had to do Louisiana one better by making it the official state tree as well (it looks like my brother and I aren't the only ones who fight over <a href=""/2011/06/03/sunflower-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day/"">flowers</a>).



The name <em>magnolia</em> comes from Pierre Magnol, a French botanist.  Magnol is a pretty important guy when it comes to plants and flowers.  He came up with the idea of plant families, a way of identifying plants that shared certain characteristics.  To honor him, Charles Plumier, another French botanist with an impressive resume, coined the genus name Magnolia in 1703.



I think magnolias are my early favorite for most impressive history.  Anything that has survived ice ages, dinosaurs, extinction of dinosaurs, not having bees around, and people is OK in my book.

How could the sight of a <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/gerbera-daisy/"">Gerbera Daisy</a> not put a smile on your face. Their colors are brilliant, their petals fan out imitating the rays of the sun, and they attract butterflies. I have received many  Gerbera Daisies for graduations, birthdays, and dance recitals, and they never get old. They add a nice punch of color to any room. Gerberas also look good when glued to that favorite headband or tucked behind an ear.

By far, Gerberas are my favorite flower in this family. Their vibrant colors and beautiful design set it apart from many other flowers.

hydrangea-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"<div itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Product"">

Today's Silk Flower Stem of the Day, the <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/hydrangeas/"">hydrangea</a>, reminds me of my parents' house in Pennsylvania.  My mom always had a hydrangea bush out front, and it was always really beautiful.  Well, thinking about it now it was pretty, but mostly I thought it was a great place to hide or an excellent bush to cut through if I was playing manhunt.  Mom did not think it was an important accessory to a game of manhunt, and we had several discussions about its use as a shortcut.

<a itemprop=""url"" href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/31-5-hydrangea-lavender/2571/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Hydrangeas at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/265x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/0/4017376945.jpg"" title=""Hydrangeas at Shinoda Design Center"" class=""alignleft"" width=""265"" height=""265"" /></a><img alt=""Hydrangeas at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/265x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/8/0856436601.jpg"" title=""Hydrangea wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" class=""alignright"" width=""265"" height=""265"" />

The name <em>hydrangea</em> comes from Greek meaning something like 'water vessel' or 'water barrel'.  Despite the Greek name, hydrangeas do not have any ties to Greek mythology, and were probably first seen in Japan, although they are native to several places.



Hydrangeas can have several conflicting meanings, from boastfulness to heartfelt feelings.  But I have another meaning after learning something interesting about them.  The leaves of the hydrangea are mildly poisonous and can sicken animals or people that eat them (silk hydrangeas do not have this problem, although I would not recommend eating your silk flowers.  In fact, please do not do that).  It is a beautiful, delicate flower with an intriguing shape, and yet, it is dangerous.  Hydrangeas remind us that not everything is at it seems, so to me it means, 'do not judge a book by its cover'.



Last but not least, I'll mention that hydrangeas are the symbol of the 4th wedding anniversary.  So far we've found out that the 12th wedding anniversary is the <a href=""/2011/06/02/peony-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day/"">peony</a> and that the 4th is the hydrangea.  But please, just like with the peonies, if you tell a customer or a client that a hydrangea is the ideal flower for his or her 4th anniversary, do not say, 'it means your significant other is pretty, but probably poisonous'.  That might not set the right mood.

The Shinoda family is a different story.  In fact, the website you're currently browsing and the store that so many of you love would not be around if it weren't for roses.  Starting with Kumaichiro Shinoda in 1906, and continuing until 1985, the Shinoda family was growing roses in the Bay area of California.  The operation spread throughout the state and even into Texas under the San Lorenzo Nursery Company name.  James wrote all about the <a href=""/shinoda-family/"">history of the Shinoda family</a> for the old site, so you can read more about how Shinoda Design Center came to be when you follow that link.



Plenty has already been written about roses and their meaning, but I did find something interesting while perusing wikipedia.  The 'thorns' on a rose stem or bush that get you if you're trying to hide behind the rose bush and the trash can are not actually thorns; they're prickles.  Thorns are actually 'modified stems' and prickles are 'outgrowths of the epidermis'.  Unfortunately, 'every rose has its prickles' doesn't sound as cool, so the prickle will most likely continue to be mistaken for a thorn.  



One thing is certain: you won't have to worry about prickles or thorns when you buy a rose at Shinoda's :).

The first thing I learned about <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/orchids/"">orchids</a> is that you cannot look up <em>orchid</em> in a flower book and get an answer.  Orchid is only one part of the story.  Wikipedia informs us that there are over 20,000 species of orchid, and to give it some perspective, mentions that that is twice the number of bird species and 4 times the number of mammal species.  So saying 'orchid' is just a little too broad.

[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""If you said, &#039;What is orchid?&#039; on Jeopardy, Alex would probably say, &#039;Be more specific&#039;.""]<a itemprop=""url"" href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/52-5-phalenopsis-orchid-white/1304/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Orchids at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/8/0856479955.jpg"" title=""Orchids wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



After reading that I need to look up <em>Cyripidium</em>, <em>Cattleya</em>, and <em>Laelia</em>, I finally found my way to <em>Phalaenopsis</em> or moth orchid.  When we lived in Philadelphia, we had a moth orchid that would show itself for a few weeks, and then retire for some undetermined amount of time before reappearing.  Eventually it stopped reappearing, and Catherine informed me that it would be sleeping for a long time.  Moth orchids are very popular, although the New Western Garden Book informs me that they are for the 'advanced amateur rather than beginner'.  I guess that's why ours is still sleeping.



Orchids come in several other popular varieties, like the <a href=""/37-cymbidium-stem-red/7361/"">Cymbidium</a>, <a href=""/25-lady-slipper-orchid-plant/7930/"">Cypripedium or Lady Slipper</a>, the <a href=""/34-kings-vanda-x9-white/8494/"">Vanda</a>, and the <a href=""/35-mini-dendrobium-spray-wht/7921/"">Dendrobium</a>.  According to the Fan Deck, all varieties of orchids symbolize love, many children, and rare beauty, so they're perfect for a bride.

tulip-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"<div itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Product"">

<a href=""/silk-flower-stems/tulips/"">Tulips</a>, another favorite of my mom's front yard, are one of the most interesting flowers we'll talk about this month.  Why?  Because tulips were responsible for an economic disaster in the Netherlands, and I'm pretty sure that no other flower has managed to do that.

[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""In 1636, you could have made a lot of money with silk tulips""]<a itemprop=""url"" href=""/24-dutch-tulip-spray-yellow/1258/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Tulips at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/8/0856428403.jpg"" title=""Tulips wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



The tulip was introduced to Europe in 1554, and by the late 1500s had become extremely popular in the Netherlands, which was then called the United Provinces.  As the popularity of tulips grew, so did the price.  This was especially true of tulips that had been affected by a virus that turned them very pretty colors.  <em>Tulip breaking virus</em> is a mosaic virus, and causes exotic coloring of the petals.  Growing diseased tulips takes a long time, and it took many trials to develop attractive, non-dead tulips (they were using a virus after all).  In 1636, the tulip market took off.  Common tulips were selling for an entire year's salary, and rare tulips went for much more.  Without any warning, prices plummeted in February of 1637, and tulip prices returned to earlier prices.  This is generally considered the first documented economic bubble, and is known as <em>tulip mania</em>.



Luckily for fans of the tulip, like my mom, it remained popular, but for a cheaper price.  The Tulipa genus has many species in an array of colors, most of which we have here at Shinoda's.  When I look through <em>Botanica</em> and see all of the beautiful reds, oranges, yellows, and other colors I can't distinguish as well, I can see what all those Dutch folks got worked up about in the 1600s.  Now we get to have all of the tulip with none of the mania.

Speaking of the black dahlia, some of you might have read or seen <em>The Black Dahlia</em>. This true story tells the tale of Elizabeth Short, a struggling actress who leads an unstable life. She is tragically murdered during a zoot suit riot. The press called her The Black Dahlia because of her stunning looks and treacherous nature. As you can see, the name is quite fitting.  



The dahlia comes in 30 different species, with 10 main groups. Some of these groups include waterlily, single-flowered, and <a href=""/26-dia-dahlia-sp-x1-w-bud-b4/1427/"">ball</a>.

<strong>Keep It Simply, Simple!</strong>



The key to offering quality fresh flowers consistently is to choose a post IlaNest care and handling system and Keep It

Simply Simple! With a few exceptions, you can process most flowers in the same manner and achieve excellent results.



<strong>Adopt a System</strong>



Adopt a system that works well to achieve your goals. Some of your major goals should be:



a. Quick hydration

b. Nourishment and hydration for the maximum enjoyment of the customer

c. Reduce scrap and customer complaints

d. Proper temperature control

e. Keep the storage areas and cooler ""smelling"" like a flower shop

f. Time efficiency

g. Maximum return for your investment in time and materials



Many businesses employ systems to make their products more consistent and to attain preset quality standards. McDonald's doesn't ""guess"" how long to leave the french fries in the fryer. A timer lets them know when they are golden brown. Dairy companies code all products with a freshness date to control quality and stock rotation. Walt Disney World doesn't ""guess"" at cleaning their parks after a day of 30,000 guests. they have a designated crew arrive at park closing to sweep and steam clean the park so it is ""fresh"" for the next day.



None of the above examples are by accident. They were all thoughtfully planned, explained to their employees, executed

and monitored. They make these simple tasks the building blocks of a successful company.  You as professional florists and business people need to adopt and consistently monitor a system of post harvest floral care. This can be the backbone of successful and profitable floral retailing.



<strong>Follow These Steps to Succesful Fresh Flower Care</strong>



Source the freshest flowers available - you usually get what you pay for! The old saying ""garbage in, garbage out"" is very true. Know what you're buying! All varieties are not the same, .. a rose is not a rose is not a rose! Do your homework. Check to make sure your wholesaler is committed to quality.



Flowers exposed to ethlene open too quickly, fail to open or have a wilted appearance.  If flowers have not been treated with an anti-ethylene product, treat as soon as possible with EthylBloc technology.  Process flowers immediately upon arrival.



Process the most expensive and ""problem flowers"" first, like roses and gerbera daisies.  Give all flowers a fresh cut just before using a hydration pretreatment and placing in a fresh flower food solution.  Remove foliage that will be below solution level to prevent rotting.



If you cut under water, use Floralife Microbloc greenhouse disinfectant.



Pretreat flowers with a hydration solution.  To help ensure maximum hydration and a free flowing stem, pretreat your flowers with a long-term formula such as Floralife Hydraflow/100 hydration solution or an instant formula such as Floralife Quick Dip hydration solution.  This can be especially helpful with field grown crops and is a must for roses and gerbera daisies to help prevent ""bent necks.""



<strong>More Steps to Successful Fresh Flow</strong>



Place flowers in a flower food solution. Flowers need to be nourished with fresh flower food to maximize their enjoyment for the customer. Flower foods generally contain:



 An acid to lower the pH of the solution. Flowers like a pH of 3 - 4.5 depending on water quality.

 Ingredients to keep the stems vascular bundle free flowing.

 An energy source (sugar) to nourish the flowers.



It is important to measure the flower food correctly to maximize results. There are two easy ways to achieve this:



1. Mark gallon levels on the side of your stock buckets

2. Take the guesswork and labor out of this step and utilize a Floralife dispensing unit.



If you want your flowers to open, let flowers stand at room temperature for 1 - 2 hours. If you are concerned about flowers opening too quickly, process them and refrigerate immediately.



Place flowers in a 34° - 36° F cooler with 75 - 85% humidity. This is crucial so you don't sacrifice shelf life for vaselife. For example: Flowers kept at 50° F will deteriorate 2 to 3 times faster than those kept at 37° F Tropicals should be kept at 55° F or at room temperature if a 55° cooler is not available. Maintaining proper humidity is important to reduce water loss which can cause water stress. Proper refrigeration can also reduce damage caused by ethlylene gas.



<strong>Final Steps for Customer Satisfaction</strong>



Give a fresh flower food packet (10 grams) with each purchase.  This will help educate the consumer on proper care and handling.



Clean buckets, coolers, tools, design benches, etc. with Floralifes D.C.D. cleaning solution. This will help keep the stems free flowing and help inhibit problems caused by bacteria. You don't want to drink out of a dirty glass - your flowers don't either! One gallon of D.C.D cleaning solution makes 128 gallons of use solution. D.C.D cleaning solution also has a residual effect of keeping the bucket clean days after treatment.



Properly soak floral foam bricks and shapes in a fresh flower food solution before using. This can help counteract the negative by-products inherent to all floral foams. Also, flowers need to be hydrated and nourished in foam just as they do in a glass vase.



Give all flowers and potted plants a spritz of Floralife Finishing Touch finishing spray to refresh, hydrate, and protect.  It's the simple, fast and last step for hydrating fresh cut flowers, foliage and potted plants to maximize customer satisfaction.  It's a must for wedding designs.



By adopting a system of professional fresh flower care, you can help maximize your clientele's enjoyment of their fresh flower purchase and add $ $ to your bottom line by reducing costly shrink.

ranunculus-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"<div itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Product"">

You might know today's Silk Flower Stem of the Day better as the buttercup, but on our website, we call it the <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/ranunculus/"">Ranunculus</a>.  While I like the mysterious sounding <em>ranunculus</em> better than <em>buttercup</em>, I agree that 'Build me up, Ranunculus', probably would not have been as big a hit.



[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""Three Ranunculi?""]<a itemprop=""url"" href=""/14-ranunculus-pick-x6-yellow/1361/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Ranunculus or Buttercup at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/8/0832571512.jpg"" title=""Ranunculus or Buttercup wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



Despite the sweet sounding name, buttercups are poisonous (this is not a problem if you buy silk buttercups :) ).  Livestock who eat them can get pretty sick, although slugs and snails seem to have no problem destroying them.  <em>Botanica</em> notes that buttercups are linked to home remedies for arthritis, sciatica, rheumatism, skin conditions, and the removal of warts, which is especially interesting given that you should probably use gloves when handling them for long periods.  I guess if you're going to be an attractive looking flower, you better have some good defense mechanisms.



The name 'buttercup' has a straightforward origin, coming from the cup shape of the flower combined with the butter-like color (and certainly has nothing to do with a buttery taste).  Ranunculus is a little less self explanatory, unless your conversational Latin is better than most.  <em>Rana</em> means ' frog' in Latin, and the culus ending means 'little'.  That makes sense because the Ranunculus looks a lot like a little frog.  Well, no, but buttercups were often found in bogs or other places where frogs hung out, hence the name.  Pretty weak if you ask me, but the Romans got there first, so I'll give it to them.



I didn't find any meanings for the Ranunculus (no fan decks down here in SD), so I've come up with one on my own.  The Ranunculus was cursed with an ugly sounding name, and it's poisonous, except to slugs, aphids, and snails, which are all trying to kill it.  Through all of those faults, it is still a popular flower, so I'll say that the buttercup is a symbol of triumph against the odds or being the underdog.  And like the Romans, I got here first, so that's what it's going to mean.



-Chris

chrysanthemum-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"<div itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Product"">

I can write about the <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/mums/"">Chrsyanthemum </a>today knowing that that is actually the name of this genus of flower.  15 years ago, I would have called them <em>Dendranthema</em>, which isn't a mum, but a ma.  So I guess the category on our website would have been 'Mas'.  Maybe not.

[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""This is a spider mum, which would beat an actual spider in a Legs Having contest""]<a itemprop=""url"" href=""/25-spider-mum-spray-yell-gld/5947/""><img itemprop=""image"" alt=""Spider Mums at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/3/3/3384952853.jpg"" title=""Spider Mums wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



The confusion over the Chrysanthemums name arose from a need to reclassify members of the genus.  Botanists were using the term Chrysanthemum to describe too broad a group of plants, so several new genera were created (bonus fact: genera is the plural of genus).  This included renaming the 'florists's chrysanthemum' or  to the <em>Dendranthema</em>.  In 1999, a ruling was made by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, naming the defining species <em>chrysanthemum indicum</em>, thereby restoring the florist's chrysanthemum to it's place in the Chrysanthemum genus.



I do have one bone to pick with the Spider Mum, which is a really cool looking mum with tendril-like petals.  I think it would be much more appropriately named the Octopus Mum, because its petals extend in all directions and orientations, like the  tentacles of an octopus floating through the water.  This would be easily shortened to Octo Mum, which could have been a great nickname for an exotic looking flower.  Unfortunately, due to the exploits of the Octo Mom, that ship has probably sailed, and I guess it's time to accept the Spider Mum name.

zinnia-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"Just a short post for today's silk flower stem of the day, the <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/zinnia/"">zinnia</a>.  This colorful flower (comes in yellow, orange, red, purple, white, and lilac, which means it pretty much goes with everything).  The most well known species, <em>zinnia elegans</em> hails from our neighbor to the south, Mexico.



[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""These are giant Zinnias.  I&#039;m not even sure if giant does them justice.""]<a href=""/51-giant-zinnia-purple/9101/""><img alt=""Zinnias at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/3/4390191743.jpg"" title=""Zinnias wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



The zinnia's namesake is Johann Gottfried Zinn, a German botanist and anatomist, famous for describing the anatomy of the human eye.  He was also very fascinated with botany, and when Carolus Linnaeus was handing out genus names, he named the Zinnia in honor of Zinn.  It must have been nice for Carolus Linnaeus to like you.  If he did, there was a good chance that he'd name an entire genus of flowers after you, and 250 years later, people would still know your name.

snowball-silk-flower-stem-of-the-day,"The <a href=""/silk-flower-stems/snowball/"">Snowball</a>, today's Silk Flower Stem of the Day, raised a lot more questions than answers for me.  First, what is a snowball?  If you look up 'snowball' in <em>Botanica</em>, somewhere between <em>smithiantha</em> and <em>solandra</em> is ... not snowball.  That's because snowball is just a nickname for another genus of flower called, <em>Viburnum</em>.



[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""All snowballs are hydrangeas, but not all hydrangeas are snowballs""]<a href=""/25-snowball-spray-x3-white/8493/""><img alt=""Snowballs at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/3/4390191754.jpg"" title=""Snowball wholesale flowers at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



Being a curious person, I was still unsatisfied.  <em>Viburnum</em> is the name of a genus, and does not refer to a specific flower.  There are about 150 species of viburnums, so which one is the snowball?  I did a quick inspection through the listed species to see what I could find, and it looked pretty similar to <em>viburnum plicatum</em> and <em>viburnum macrocephalum</em>.  Viburnum plicatum is also know as the Japanese Snowball Bush, and I believe these are the ones we have.



So what have I learned?  If you call something a rose, or a viburnum, or any other genus or family name, it's a pretty broad term.  When I read about <a href=""/2011/06/09/orchid-silk-flower-of-the-day/"">orchids</a>, I learned that there were over 20,000 species of orchid.  However, if you say, 'I'd really like a viburnum plicatum', that might not get you very far either.  Ultimately, the name doesn't matter too much ('a rose by any other name ... ').  It doesn't really matter if I can't figure out exactly which species of viburnum the snowball is.  You know how it looks, and if it fits in with what you're designing, and that's what matters.

Proteas are ancient.  I know I thought magnolias were old, but proteas make magnolias look like the new kid on the block.  Ancestors of the protea are 300 <em>million</em> years old.  Wikipedia told me that proteas were native to Gondwanaland.  I thought that wikipedia had made up a word, but Gondwanaland was actually a real place.  When all of the 7 continents were grouped together forming Pangea, the southernmost 'supercontinent' was Gondwanaland.  If you're wondering, the other supercontinent was called Laurasia, although I don't think anyone at the time called it Laurasia since it was mostly non-speaking amphibians and invertebrates.



So they're really old.  They're also a controversial national symbol of South Africa.  During the Apartheid era, most of the sports teams were represented by a Springbok, which is an antelope.  Even though the Springbok mascot came about before Apartheid, it had developed a close association with Apartheid, and it was unpopular with anti-Apartheid groups.  The protea, native to Southern Africa, was proposed as an alternative that would appeal to all South Africans.  The protea is now the symbol of all South African sports teams, except the rugby team, which has received a special exemption.



Over 300 million years old and still causing problems today.  Not bad for one flower.

A typical floral design competition consists of two rounds. The first is the designer's choice round. During this round, the floral designer must complete an arrangment consisting of fresh flowers and supplies that they have chosen. There are usually limits on what types of flowers and supplies used. The finished arrangement must also fit into a stated theme. The fun is only starting as they move into round two the ""Surprise Package"". For the ""Surprise Package"" round, the designer's are all given the same flowers and supplies. Under the pressure of a running clock, they must complete an arrangement that fits within the stated theme of the round. This is when you see how truly creative designers can be. I've always found it remarkable how different the arrangements can be even though the designers are forced to use the exact same materials.

I began our cataloging efforts in the middle of 2009.  Everything was done in house including researching our e-commerce platform, designing the pages, customizing the pages, starting the accumulation of pictures, and a brief introduction into the world of open source programming and computer code.  At the time, I thought it wouldn't take long to get the site up and product shipped out.  Little did I realize or appreciate the amount of knowledge, skill, and patience it would take to move the project along.



For those of you that have been watching the website evolve, I did not realize how problematic the picture gathering would be.  Almost every vendor picture was formatted for print catalog publication.  This meant that we had different sized pictures and oftentimes many products in a single picture that could not be Photoshopped out.  This required us to take almost every single image ourselves.  With the amount of resources we have devoted to this, you will have a better understanding of why we lock our pictures down so that they cannot be scraped off of our site and the delay in us getting to our ultimate goal of a fully functional and shipping website.



You may have noticed some significant changes to the site in the last couple of months.  Along the way, I went from being a solo act on web development to a department of three.  I am completely self trained.  As the project evolved and expanded, I found that I lacked the technical expertise required and needed help to finish.  That is when Chris took over the helm as Chief Web Architect and he is behind all the wonderful changes that have occurred.



From here, we will continue to add new product.  We are working towards that final step of full e-commerce functionality as we speak.  It is not easy to coordinate and set this up.  We have to understand how to bill for shipping and teach ourselves to become a shipping company as well as continue to operate the warehouses most of you have shopped.  I would like to thank every one of our web users for being patient with us as we continue to finalize our web project.

July 4th is a pretty important holiday for me.  I grew up in the Philadelphia area, and spent 5.5 years in Center City, Philadelphia, before I moved out here in January.  About 20 blocks east of my house was Independence Hall, where the United States Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4th, 1776.  A few blocks from that sits the Liberty Bell.  And surrounding that area in Old City are houses that belonged to people like Benjamin Franklin and Betsy Ross, the church that George Washington attended while he was in the city, and the Delaware River that George Washington and his troops famously crossed in the winter of 1776.  I would often walk down there for some other purpose, only to find myself watching a crowd of people seeing the Liberty Bell for the first time.



So that's what I'll be thinking about this July 4th.  And even if Orange County is just about as far away from Philadelphia as you can be and still be in the continental United States, it still has Philadelphia to thank for hosting the beginning of our nation.  Bring your coupon (which is just at the bottom of this post) and get 25% off our Americana inventory so you can express your patriotism in your own way.  If I see you in the store, I can tell you all about the city of brotherly love and the founding of the United States.  I can even show you my Pennsylvania tattoo, complete with Philadelphia area code (seriously, I have one of those).



Hope to see you at the store!

san-diego-floral-design-competition,"Most people go to the fair to enjoy the rides, games, and especially the food.  My first time to the fair in 20 years, I went for the San Diego Floral Design Competition, this past Sunday June 26<sup>th</sup>, at the San Diego County Fair.



Floral competitions generally have 2 parts: Designers Choice and Surprise Package.  There is usually a theme for the designs and there are of course size limitations.



For this competition, the designers were given 45 minutes to complete the first portion based on the theme Riding in Style.  They came with their flowers fully in tact, their armatures or containers set, and their tools ready.  Its fascinating to see the designs come to life, especially in this case because they had to incorporate Riding.  We saw tires, steering wheels, little toy cars, checkered flags, and various carriages and wheels.



The Surprise Package is great because none of the designers know what to expect.  They are all given the same materials: flowers, greens, ribbon, tulle, chenille (pipe cleaners to those of us outside of the industry), flat wire, oasis, pew holders, and in this case wire hangers and a chair.  They had 30 minutes to complete their design.



The goal was to use the materials present to create a floral design that would decorate the chairs for a VIP benefit dinner sponsoring a racing event.  A few of us discussed this part of the competition afterwards and decided next time the Surprise Package should include Match Box cars.ooo! or maybe toy tires to tie into the ends of the ribbon.  I think it could work.  This was a tough theme!



After long deliberation and tallying, the winners were announced:



1<sup>st</sup> place: Suzie Bowen



2<sup>nd</sup> place: Sonja Longley



3<sup>rd</sup> place and Peoples Choice Winner: Masako Lesure



I did make it into the other parts of the fair, but I stayed away from those fried concoctions everyone is so crazy about.  Maybe in another 20 yearsIll stick to flowers for now.



See you around the store!

local-teleflora-florists-celebrate-make-someone-smile%c2%ae-week-july-17-23-2011,"<strong>LOS ANGELES (June 29, 2011)</strong>  Teleflora, the worlds leading flower wire service, offering only hand-arranged, hand-delivered floral arrangements, announced today its plans for <em>Make Someone Smile<sup>®</sup> Week</em>, the floral industrys leading benevolent program running from Sunday, July 17 through Saturday, July 23. Thousands of Teleflora member florists and community volunteers are set to deliver flower bouquets in the companys keepsake Be Happy® Mug to those most in need of a smile  such as hospital patients, senior citizens living in nursing homes and assisted living homes, and recipients of Meals-on-Wheels programs.



Teleflora will donate more than <strong>40,000</strong> of their <em>Be Happy</em>® <em>Mugs</em> through its units program to member florists, who will work with local wholesalers and growers to secure donated flowers. Local Teleflora florists will use these donations to make cheery <em>Be Happy</em>® <em>Bouquets, </em>full of beautiful flowers, and deliver them to residents of their choosing in their local communities.



Last year marked the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of <em>Make Someone Smile<sup>®</sup> Week</em> and its wonderful that in year 11, the florists continue to amaze me with their interest and enthusiasm for the program, said Rich Salvaggio, Vice President of Industry Relations and Publications, Teleflora.  The joy on the faces of the recipients reinforces why this program continues to be so successful with the help of our local unit boards, florists and volunteers.



As florists around the country are making deliveries during <em>Make Someone Smile<sup>®</sup> Week,</em> consumers can order a smile for that special someone in their lives by visiting <a href=""http://www.teleflora.com/"">http://www.teleflora.com</a> and purchasing a<em> Be Happy</em>® <em>Bouquet</em> for $46.95.



Last years program spanned over<strong> 200 </strong>cities throughout the United States and Canada; more than <strong>2,000</strong> florists donated their time.  Telefloras program delivered more than <strong>33,000 </strong>bouquets to those most in need of a smile.  For more information on Telefloras <em>Make Someone Smile<sup>®</sup> Week,</em> or how you can get involved,<strong> </strong>call 310.966.8328."
christmas-in-july-25-off-selected-christmas-products-at-shinoda,"It's that special time of year that every little boy and girl dream about ... <a href=""/christmas/"">Christmas </a>in July Eve!



Well, at least every little boy and girl at Shinoda dream about it.  That's because tomorrow, Shinoda Design Center kicks off the beginning of <em>our</em> Christmas season.  It's an exciting time to be at the store, as the aisles are teeming with excited/frantic shoppers, sorting through thousands of Christmas products, trying to make a decision.



[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600"" caption=""My name is Poinsettia, and I&#039;m 25% off at Shinoda Design Center during July""]<a target=""_blank"" href=""/christmas/poinsettias/""><img alt=""Poinsettias at Shinoda Design Center"" src=""/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x600/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/f/i/file_3_3.jpg"" title=""Poinsettias at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>[/caption]



But why does it start so early?  I mean, July is the middle of summer.  Back home, we were trying very hard not to think about winter or anything cold in July (although out here, the weather at Christmas time is only a little cooler than July).  Even thinking about Labor Day made us a little skittish.  So why are we already talking about Christmas?



Because we have to.  Christmas comes earlier and earlier in the retail world these days.  It's not uncommon to see Christmas items out in October in some high profile retail locations.  Since we're a wholesale operation, we need to be ready to serve those customers ahead of that schedule.  We're in full Christmas swing by the time September rolls around (I'm already shaking thinking about Mark coming back and telling me I need to cashier.  For all I know about computers, I still don't understand our point of sale program).



July is your chance to beat the rush.  Here are just a few reasons you should shop our July sale:

<ol>

	<li>Christmas is definitely happening again this year.  I just double checked to make sure.</li>

	<li>Your clients are going to want Christmas stuff.  I don't have to double check that.</li>

	<li>Right now, you can get selected Christmas merchandise for 25% less than at the last minute.</li>

	<li>Right now, you can get first crack at Christmas merchandise, before it's been thoroughly picked through.</li>

	<li>Because <a href=""/christmas/poinsettias/"">poinsettias</a> are 25% off, and we have a ridiculous selection of poinsettias.</li>

</ol>

Will we still have great Christmas stuff in December?  Sure.  We'll even have great stuff the week before Christmas; that's what we do.  But during July, you can get a lot of it for 25% off, and you won't have to contend with the other shoppers during the pre-Christmas frenzy.  Check out all the details on the flyer below.

first-endcap-of-christmas,"I went out on the floor the other day to catch our designers in the act of setting up a Christmas endcap.  One problem: camera was out of batteries.  So unfortunately I couldn't get any pictures of them in the design process, but I did take some pictures of their handiwork a little later.[caption id=""attachment_860"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""640"" caption=""Christmas time is here""]<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Christmas-Endcap-Shinoda-Design-Center-4.jpg""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Christmas-Endcap-Shinoda-Design-Center-4-1024x682.jpg"" alt=""Christmas Endcap at Shinoda Design Center"" title=""Christmas Endcap at Shinoda Design Center"" width=""640"" height=""426"" class=""size-large wp-image-860"" /></a>[/caption]



I can't get over how detailed the endcaps are.  There's the papering of the back, the decorations running up the four corners of the endcaps, and even the tops.  It's really nice to look at our professionally designed endcaps (as the pro designers out there already know) because our designers know how to create an attractive display without making it too busy, too plain, too empty, or too confusing.  Sometimes I'm lucky enough to stumble upon an attractive looking layout, but our designers actually know why that is attractive or what about it is particularly eye catching.  Since my first question is usually, 'what color is this again?', I think I'll leave the endcap design to the pros.  Luckily, we have some good ones working at Shinodas.



I'll be posting more pictures as they come in.  Christmas is a really exciting time for us at Shinoda's, and the Christmas endcaps are part of what makes Shinoda's, Shinoda's.  Hopefully the photos can do them some justice, although they're really best viewed in person.

Our mummies represent a departure from the traditional mummy.  Realizing that he's not very good at terrorizing people, he's gotten himself a Halloween colored bow tie, and he's probably heading to a Halloween party somewhere with his 'Happy Haunting' bat.

Fall and I never really got along.  I still don't understand why people like 'crisp' autumn days.  To me, that just means it's about to be winter (note: for the seasonally deprived readers, winter in Philadelphia is cold.  Really cold).  So while fall days were not particularly upsetting, they were a sign of colder days to come, and that is upsetting.  Fall also has this thing about leaves changing color and everything being very pretty, which is lost on the colorblind of us, who see the leaves change from bright to less bright and then fall off.  Besides routinely trying to buy pink shoes thinking they're gray, it's my one regret of being colorblind.



But fall in southern California is a totally different thing.  The temperature does drop, but here it goes from about 72.5 to 72.4, which is nice.  And I still get to keep the best part of fall, which is football season!  Yes, the leaves will still confuse me, but at least I can stand outside in 70 degree weather while I try to figure out how 'red' and 'orange' are different as opposed to 50 degree weather.



Now that you're excited about a southern California fall, print out the coupon below and save 25% on your fall supplies.  Looking for some <a href=""/seasonal/thanksgiving-fall/gourds-pumpkins/"" title=""pumpkins"" target=""_blank"">pumpkins </a>for your window display?  We have those.  How about some <a href=""/decor-display/fruits-mushrooms-vegetables/"" title=""Fruits and Vegetables"" target=""_blank"">fall fruit</a> for your next centerpiece?  We've got those and a whole lot more, so come by and check out our fall selection.



See you around the store.

tip-of-the-day-floratape,"Are you familiar with the term floral tape?  If not, floral tape is typically used in smaller floral arrangements such as boutinierres and corsages to bind the stems together.  The most commonly seen colors are green or white.  However, it also comes in brown, black, and a rainbow assortment.



Many novices have trouble working with it because out of the box it is not tacky.  To activate the tackiness of the floral tape, stretch it.  It is that simple.

Votive candles usually have a rated life of 10 hours.  Yet, oftentimes, they burn for far less.  Here are a couple of tips to get the most out of your votive's life.



<ol>

<li>You must use a votive holder that is the right size!  If the votive holder is too wide or has an abnormal shape to it, the wax will spread out and the wick will be unable to burn all of it.  If you have a lot of wax left after the candle has burnt out at the bottom of the holder, it was not the right size.</li><br />

<li>Votive candles are designed from a low melt wax.  This means that it spreads out easier then other types of candles.  If the votive holder is fits tightly around the candle, it will burn longer.</li>

</ol>



The next time you are burning a votive candle, try these tips.  Not only will you have less candle wax to clean up at the end, your votive candle will have burned longer!

shinoda-scholarship-foundation-anounces-2011-12-awards,"SHINODA SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION INVESTS OVER $21,000 

IN HORTICULTURE'S FUTURE THROUGH ITS 2011-12 AWARDS



   San Luis Obispo, Calif., July 6, 2011  The Joseph Shinoda Memorial Foundation Inc. recently honored horticultures best and brightest, while awarding more than $21,000 in scholarships to students from across the nation.



   These students are the future of our industry, said Paul Ecke III, president of the Shinoda Foundation. Its a privilege to contribute to their success and the growth of horticulture as a whole.



    Award recipients are carefully selected based on criteria including career goals, work experience, academics, extracurricular activities and need.



Shinoda Foundation Scholarships



   The 2011-12 recipients of Shinoda Foundation Scholarships include:



      Amy J. Hinkle (Senior), $5,000, Pennsylvania State University.



     Jenny S. Freed (Junior/Senior), $3,000, University of Nebraska-Lincoln.



     Brianna M. Swanson (Senior), $3,000, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.



     George A. Heimos, Jr. (Junior/Senior), $2,500, University of Missouri-Columbia.

    As part of its continuing effort to support horticulture education, the Shinoda Foundation also sends 10 percent of each scholarship as an incentive to the winners educational institution department.



Floral Design Scholarships



    Introduced last year, two of the Shinoda Foundations scholarships recognize exceptional community college floral design students. Applications are accepted from students majoring in floral design at community colleges in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties.



   For 2011-12, Christine M. Rutan from Golden West College, Huntington Beacah, Calif., received a $1,000 Shinoda Design Center Scholarship, and Amy L. Rhodes, also from Golden West College, received a $500 Jimmy Shinoda Memorial Scholarship.



Los Angeles Flower Market Scholarship



    The recipient of the Los Angeles Flower Market Scholarship is George Heimos, Jr. of University of Missouri Columbia. This award was created through the Foundations directed scholarship program, which provides a simple way to make a lasting tribute to a cherished family member or colleague, or to recognize the importance of an entire company.



About the Joseph Shinoda Memorial Scholarship Foundation



   Information about applications for the Shinoda Foundation's scholarships is sent each January to horticulture and floriculture departments at universities across the nation. Applications are available on the foundations website and accepted from January until March 30 each year.

During the Christmas season, we are frequently asked, ""How long is this set of Christmas lights?""



If it is a standard strand of Christmas lights like the picture above, take the number of lights and divide by 2.  For instance, a strand of 100 lights would be (100/2=50) 50 feet.  Typically it is right around this number if you include the length of the lead cord.



If you want a more precise way, measure the distance between the lights and multiply that number by the total number of lights.  For example, 100 lights with a 5"" distance would be (100x5""=500"" and 500""/12=45 feet) 45 feet.



Remember, this tip only works with standard light sets.  It does not apply to icicle lights or the various other forms of lights with different bulbs.  Also, we sell a light strand that is specifically marked with a 4"" spacing and the tip will not work with them.

shopping-cart-is-up-and-running,"This is very exciting for us: our online shopping cart is up in beta mode!  That means you can start shopping online, and we can start sending your items directly to your business. 



What does 'Beta' mode mean?  It means that we're still tweaking some things and that there may be some bumps in the road. We ask that you be patient with us if we have any hiccups in the ordering process.  We've already run a few orders without any issues, but we'd just like to get a little more practice before we remove the beta tag.



<strong>So how do you shop with us online?</strong>



First, you need to <a href=""/customer/account/create/"" title=""Shinoda Design Center registration"" target=""_blank"">register</a> and <a href=""/wholesale-activation/"" title=""Shinoda Design Center wholesale activation"" target=""_blank"">activate</a> your account.  Online shopping with us is still <strong>wholesale</strong> only.



After you've registered and activated, you should be able to <a href=""/customer/account/login/"" title=""Shinoda Design Center account login"" target=""_blank"">login</a> to your account.  You can click the link at the top of every page to login.  Once you've logged in, you can browse our products, and you will now have the option to add those products to your cart.



When you've added all of the products you want to your cart, you can <a href=""/checkout/onepage"" title=""Shinoda Design Center checkout"" target=""_blank"">checkout</a>.  We accept Visa, Mastercard, and American Express for your online orders.



Once your order is placed, we will pull and ship your merchandise.  If we have to make any adjustments to your order, we will let you know.  For instance, if we are short on quantity or need to adjust the shipping rate, we will notify you by phone or e-mail.  We will never charge you more than the price you agreed to without your consent first.  For instance, if our shipping estimate turns out to be low or requires more boxes than we thought, we may have to increase your shipping charge.  In that case, we will contact you and work it out.



Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when shopping with us:

<ul>

	<li>Shipping glass can be expensive, especially in larger quantities.

tip-of-the-day-how-long-will-a-paper-mache-container-hold-water,"<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/paper-mache-containers/""><img alt=""Recreations Paper Mahce Vase"" src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/images/designideas/recreations_Page_1.jpg"" title=""Western Pulp Recreations Paper Mache Container"" class=""aligncenter"" width=""300""/></a>



Paper mache containers are primarily used as a liner for fresh flower arrangements to be dropped into containers that are not intended to hold water.  Oftentimes, they are used in funeral work because of their light weight and the ease of transporting arrangements made in them.  We are often asked how long they will hold water.



To get the most accurate answer, I placed a call into Western Pulp, the distributor responsible for our paper mache container lines.  Their answer is that the paper mache container should outlast the life of the floral arrangement.  To be safe, they provided a guideline of about 7 days for the paper mache container.  This applies to both the standard paper mache container and their designer line called Recreations.



It is also advised that you do not recycle paper mache containers and instead always use a new one.



To get some creative ideas on how to use paper mache containers in your floral designs, see our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/design-ideas/"">Design Ideas</a> section!

tip-of-the-day-diy-halloween-cobwebs,"Having worked in Shinoda Design Center warehouses for a quarter century now, I have learned a tip or two.  I am not sure of this tip's origins.  I just know that most designers seem to know it and thought I would pass it along.



Have you ever seen a Halloween display and wondered how the cobweb effect was created?  I am not talking about the cotton or thread factory created kinds.  The kind that wrap figurines and have a much more random weave.



Here is what you need: two blocks of styrofoam, a hot glue pan, and the hot glue pan chips to place in the pan.  Turn on the glue pan letting the glue heat and turn to liquid.  Dip one block of styrofoam into it.  Next, take the block of styrofoam and with the glue side facing down, push it against the other block of styrofoam.  Pull them apart, and voila!  You should have a web that has been created between the two blocks of styrofoam.  Quickly rub the ends of the web onto whatever you would like it to be on.

First, let me say that there is no exact number for the lights that should go on a Christmas tree.  This is due to the variability in how bright someone wants the tree, how closely or far apart they want the differing level of lights to be, how tightly or loosely they place the strands, and the type of tree itself.



The following recommendations are very loose places to start and are  generalized for the average Christmas tree.

If you have ever wandered down our ribbon aisles, you will notice that some of the ribbon does not have an inch description for its width.  Instead it has numbers like #3, #5, #9, or #40.  This is a carryover from the days that satin acetate was the dominant ribbon on the market.  With the advent of all the new novelty ribbons in the last 20 years, the width numbering system is used sporadically and can be confusing.  Here is a table that transaltes what those numbers correspond to in inches.

We are pleased to announce that Pearl Barro Navo, AIFD will be one of the featured designers at the Santa Ana Christmas Design Show on Sunday September 11, 2011.  The following is her bio:



 CFD has been in the floral industry for over 25 years. Pearl first began designing in a local shop in high school, and then later working part time while attending college. Flowers have always been her passion, so she looked into floral design as her profession. She began her career by owning the flower shop in the Disneyland Hotel. It was not long after that she then knew the next step would be to get into AIFD , and was inducted in Boston in 1992. She soon founded and planed the new floral department for the Ritz Carlton in Laguna Beach. Later, Pearl began working as a consultant for a  high end catering company in Orange County and to this day, continues to add her creative design to their  events.



Now, being in AIFD for over 17 years, she enjoys freelancing and traveling for another large event company creating breath taking floral designs for all their shows. Traveling  to  Hawaii and Jamaica to design floral arrangements for events held by  large companies including Nissan and HP, have had to have been a couple of the most exhilarating moments of her design career.

tip-of-the-day-the-truth-about-dripless-taper-candles,"<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/candles/tapers/""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/0070300001-300x300.jpg"" alt=""18&quot; Taper Candle Red"" title=""18&quot; Taper Candle Red"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1153"" /></a>



Over the years, I have taken many requests for dripless taper candles.  Since, we do not carry any candles specifically labeled as dripless, I decided to inquire about them with our major candle vendors.  The answer was surprising.  Uniformly, I was informed that ANY taper candle can be dripless.  First, they have to be manufactured so that the candle is perfectly perpendicular to the ground.  The candle cannot have even the slightest variation due to manufacturing.  Second, the user must place the candle into its holder perfectly.  Again, there can be no variation to the candle being perfectly upright or a drip will ensue.  Finally, there can be no air flow blowing on the candle which includes fans, ventilation of any kind, air conditioning, heating, or the wind caused by people passing by.



Since meeting all of these conditions is virtually impossible, the candle vendors cannot ""guarantee"" dripless candles.

Although we do not sell any fresh flowers, our history and much of our product line is based around them.  Today's tip is a care and handling one involving a very popular flower.



Hydrangeas are a beautiful and popular flower.  They are so beautiful that a handful can be dropped in a glass vase to create a table arrangment.  This tip will help you keep them looking fresh and beautiful for longer.



Most people assume that flowers take in water through their stems that are placed in water.  For hydrangeas, this is only partly true.  They also take in a great deal of water through their petals.  So, if your hydrangeas are starting to look wilty and old, take them out of the vase and soak them in a tub of water for an hour.  Also, cut one inch from the stem to help the hydration from the stem.

Stickum is a great product that has a number of uses.  Did you know that you could use it to secure candle wax to wood, metal, or glass?  Place a pea sized piece of stickum on the bottom of the candle.  Place the candle into the holder and twist the candle to set the stickum.

Since everyone seems to love candles so much, we are going to add another candle tip.  This one is quite simple but will help those that frequently burn candles.



When you extinguish a candle, it is usually accompanied by smoke and the smell of smoke.  Also, the wick can be difficult to relight.  To extinguish the candle, take something non-flammable and push the wick into the pool of wax.  Not only will this extinguish the candle, the wax coating will prevent the smoke and accompanying smell.  Also, when you go to relight the candle, the wick will be primed with wax and be much easier to ignite.

Among the necessary tools for any floral designers is a trusted florist knife.  It is also one of the first required tools in any basic floral design class.  With your handy knife in hand, beginners are taught to cut flower stems at an angle and under water for best preservation practices.  With all the scissors, stem cutters, and pruners out there, why is this?



The answer is actually quite simple.  When scissors, stem cutters, or pruners are used, they can kink the stem and stop all water from being absorbed up the stem.  Using a knife will prevent this and your flowers will last longer.

One of the most basic floral design products is <a href =""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/floral-foam-products/"">floral foam</a>.  We have multiple sources and kinds of foam in our warehouses.  To properly hydrate them, follow these basic guidelines.  First, get a large tub of water and fill it up.  Place the bricks of floral foam into this tub and allow them to absorb the water until they float levelly on the top.  Do not place the bricks under running water or push them beneath the water to speed up absorption.  Doing either of these will cause air bubbles to be trapped in the foam which results in pockets of dry foam.  These pockets of dry foam will not work to hydrate the stems you are pushing into it.



If you need the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/floral-foam-products/"">floral foam</a> to soak up water faster, look for <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/instant-oasis-48-cs/2101/"">Instant Floral Foam</a>.

I have sent flowers to several grieving families in the past year.  When you are making the arrangements with the florist, the question gets asked whether you want to send a funeral or sympathy flower arrangement.  What is the difference?



Funeral flowers are meant for the funeral home.  They are usually one sided and represent the life of the deceased.  A typical piece includes floral foam wreaths or shapes hung from an easel.  Typically they are emblazoned with symbols like flags for a soldier, the masonic symbol for a mason, the family name, or something representative of the individual.



Sympathy flowers can be sent to either the funeral home or the directly to the grieving family.  They are meant to be more personal and are directed more towards the family of the deceased.

Since the launch of our blog, all of my posts have been of a formal or professional nature.  I am deviating from that since this one is both personal and informal.  I hope you will not mind my journey down memory lane.



With the coming of the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas-shows-2011/"">San Diego Christmas Show</a>, I am reminded of my Grandfather's death on September 23, 2009.  Since 1994, when I joined the company in a management position, we had a tradition.  During the week leading up to the show, we would talk and he would he be full of advice as I asked him questions to finalize our prep based on how things went at the Santa Ana show the week before.  However, at the end of this particular week, I received a call that he had been rushed to the emergency room and the outlook was looking very grim.



If you have been to our shows before, you know how drastically the appearance of the warehouse changes.  It is a very busy week.  So, taking the time to drive up to Orange County to see him in the hospital was difficult from a warehouse operations and show setup viewpoint.  Even harder was actually going through with the show and being able to work through this.



My guiding light was the lifelong lessons I had been taught by my Grandfather about work, dedication, and follow through.  I knew then and now that no matter what happened, he would have wanted the show to go on.  Supported by several cousins that made the journey down to San Diego from Orange County, we successfully held the show in the absence of my grandfather and several other senior family members.



The uniqueness of Shinoda Design Center warehouses is a result of how he envisioned the warehouses should be merchandised and how products should be displayed.  Believe me when I say, his hand influenced nearly every decision that has been made in the 25 years of the company's existence.  If you have a moment in the warehouse, take a look around, and I hope you enjoy how much of a true visionary my Grandfather was.

If you have been into the warehouse and taken a look at our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/trees/"">Christmas trees</a> or <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/other-silks-drieds/trees/"">silk trees (like raphis, bamboo, ficus, or a palm)</a>, you might think that the height measurement is pretty arbitrary.  One six foot <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/trees/"">Christmas tree</a> looks about the same height as different styled seven footer.  What is the deal?



First, the trees come from an assortment of manufacturers.  If you see a line of trees from the same factory in different heights, it is pretty easy to see the difference.  It is when you are comparing trees from different factories that it gets tougher.  Our general guide for determining the height of a tree is to measure the tree from the ground to the absolute highest point the tree will reach.  With a Christmas tree, this means measuring to the very tip of the topper.  The next time you see a <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/trees/"">Christmas tree</a> that seems to be a very good deal, take a look at the topper piece.  I have seen pieces that were eight or nine inches long and turned a three foot tree into a four footer.



When measuring a <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/other-silks-drieds/trees/"">silk tree (raphis, ficus, bamboo, etc.)</a>, push the top leaves up, like it was wrapped in plastic.  Measure from the ground to the tip of the highest reaching piece.  What you think is a six foot tree might be called a seven footer because of this.



Not all factories do this.  They either keep the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/trees/"">Christmas tree</a> top piece a height proportionate size or measure only from the natural resting spot of a silk tree with the leaves falling into their natural position.  So, it is always best to take a firm meaurement of the space the purchased tree will be placed in and then measure the tree you are purchasing to ensure it will fit.  Do not just rely on the stated height of the tree.

If you have ever worked with <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">styrofoam</a>, you know it can get very messy and frustrating.  One of the classic uses of <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">styrofoam</a> is to take a block of it and create a shape out of it.  If you did not know, there are many <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">pre-made styrofoam shapes</a> that can be found in our online store.  However, if you need a shape that is not available, the only choice is to create it yourself.  If you have never tried cutting <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">styrofoam</a> or been unsuccessful at it, this tip is for you!



We sell both a <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/5-5-styrofoam-sabre-saw/8956/"">styrofoam sabre saw</a> and a <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/10-wonder-cut-plus-x1/8944/"">heated blade</a> that slices through styrofoam.  If one of these is not available to you or you do not have the time to get one, make sure you use a knife or saw that has a serrated edge to it, like most steak knives.  The smaller the serrating (meaning more jaggedy edges per inch), the better.

With the number of candles available today, one would expect to be able to find the right candle for just about any occasion.  Most often, the problem is with the candle color.  I have been asked on numerous occasions if candles can be spray painted.  If you are planning on burning the candle, the answer is no.  Here's why.



With the regular colors such as red, brown, blue, or yellow, the candles will burn the spray paint causing a very bad smelling fume to be released.  In certain instances, the candle wax will burn and leave a shell of paint surrounding the candle.  If this happens, the shell can collapse and will ignite causing an immediate fire hazard.  Because of the fumes released and the fire hazard risk, it is never recommended to spray color onto a candle.



With metallic colors such as gold, silver, copper, or platinum, there is actually flecks of metal in the paint.  When these metallic flakes are caught in a flame, they spark and float upward.  If you have been to a magic show and the magician creates a ""fireworks"" show by throwing powder at a fire, it is the same effect.  Different materials will cause different color sparks.

Over the years, I have fielded many questions about our ceramic vases.  The most common is whether they are waterproof.  So, what's the answer?



We carry very few ceramic vases that are guaranteed waterproof.  In fact, after walking the San Diego warehouse, I did not see a single one on the shelf at the moment.  Among the various ceramic vase companies we have done business with over the years, only Haegar comes to mind in guaranteeing their products as waterproof.  The guarantee comes with a significant price premium and many years ago we quit carrying their products because we were not selling them.



After talking to several of our ceramic companies, it is mainly a pricing and liability reason.  During the firing process that ceramic containers go through, the heat can cause microfractures in the glaze.  The glaze is what would make the vase waterproof.  To guarantee that a glaze does not crack greatly increases the cost of production.  Similar to our Haegar situation, the market for high priced waterproof ceramics is not big enough to warrant mass market adoption.  When faced with high priced ceramic vases, most customers will switch to glass, metal, or resin vases.



Also, if a vase that was guaranteed to be waterproof leaked onto something like a grand piano, the potential liability issues are enormous and would further raise the prices manufacturers would have to charge.



So, when walking around our warehouses, the vases that are waterproof are almost always marked that way as a selling point.  If they are not marked, you can pretty much assume that they are NOT waterproof.

Do you have a box of ribbon remnants from past projects and gift wrapping?  Here are five ideas to use them.



<ol>

<li>Use it as a hair tie.</li>

<li>Embellish a card by tying the ribbon around it.</li>

<li>Need a napking ring?  Use ribbon remnants to create one.</li>

<li>Have ornaments or display items that need to be hung?  Turn the ribbon remnants into a hanger. The best part about using ribbon is you can make the hanger any length.</li>

<li>Throwing a wine tasting party?  Tie a different ribbon around the base of the wine glasses.  The glasses will be easier to identify that way.</li>

</ol>

happy-first-day-of-fall,"Being a nature lover, I can say I am a fan of each season of the year.  As each of us does, I have personal reasons to place Fall at the top of my list.  I spent my childhood in Western New York State amongst colorful apple trees, sweaters, scarves, and cups of hot cocoa.  I spent hours jumping into piles of leaves and walking down the sidewalk looking for the crunchiest leaf to pounce on.  Southern California poses some problems for my Fall festivities...so I've decided to spend the next few weeks informing you of seasonal items we carry here at Shinoda Design Center.



Why not bring some of the beauty of Autumn indoors?



Today I wanted something simple and quick that included fall colors and leaves.  I chose candles, maple leaves, and some fabric and added in some pottery from my cupboard.  As I said earlier, I love piles of leaves, so there is some necessary disarray in my ideas.  Wind doesn't blow leaves into a straight line.  Here are some unfinished ideas my brainstorming produced...

You have been into our warehouse and shopped it.  When you get home, you start assembling your project only to find that you are a few pieces short.  Your next step is to call and tell us you want more.  How do you identify the item?



Whether it be online, or on the phone, giving us the barcode will cut down on the time we have to search for the item.  With over 30,000 active items in our warehouses, telling us a name or a simple description often does not help us in locating it.  Having the barcode is the surefire way.  How do know what the barcode is?  Look at the picture above.  It is circled in red.



If you want to order an item online, you can check availability by just typing that barcode into our search bar.  Our search bar will check every product barcode to find a match.  Unfortunately, we still only have about 20% of our items online.  So, you might not find them there.  If you do not, feel free to <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/contact/"">email</a> us or call into a warehouse to check availability.  Once again, just provide us the barcode and we will look it up for you.

Our line of charger plates has grown considerably the last few years.  Seeing how many people use them now, I became curious about their etiquette.  This is what I found out.



There really is no firm and strict rule regarding their use.  Some people keep them on the table throughout the meal and serve dishes on top of them.  Others use them for presentation and remove them while guests are initially seated.  If you choose to serve meals on top of them, it is recommended to remove them during dessert since chargers are usually significantly larger then dessert plates.

If you are wondering if a particular product is food-safe or not, always presume it is NOT.  If a product is food-safe, it will have a marking either in the description or on the product itself that proclaims it to be food-safe.

Here are some simple rules to follow when cleaning silk flowers and greens.  Follow these rules and silk flowers, plants, or trees should last for several years.



<ol>

<li>Try to place your silk flowers, plants, and trees in a location that is cool and out of direct sunlight.  Hot temperatures and direct sunlight can cause colors to fade.</li>



<li>Do not use a vacuum to remove dust.  The vacuum may cause the petals and leaves to rip apart or fall off.</li>



<li>Instead of a vacuum, use a small feather duster or soft cloth.  Done a weekly basis, this will prevent an excessive dust build up.</li>



<li>You can also used canned air to help dust.  To get better results, use the feather duster first.  This will loosen dirt and make it easier to blow away.</li>



<li>If you choose to wash your silk flowers, greens, and trees, make sure you do not use soap.  Also, always use COLD water.</li>



<li>When drying them, place them out of sunlight and allow them to air dry in a shaded area.  Using a dryer or the sun can cause them to fade or fray.</li>



<li>When not in use, cover them with some kind of protective layer.  Plastic trash bags work well.</li>

</ol>

<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">Styrofoam</a> is a very popular choice among crafters who need a frame or shape to build on.  Whether it be a custom colored and decorated cross or ball, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">styrofoam</a> is pretty easy to use.  The problem starts when you need the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">styrofoam</a> to be a color other then the standard white or green.  How do you paint <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">styrofoam</a>?



Do not use normal spray paint.  The enamel in regular spray paint is corrosive to the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/styrofoam/"">styrofoam</a> causing it to dissolve and be eaten away.  The end product looks corroded and the surface layer will be pitted.



The answer is to use a latex or oil based paint applied maunally with a brush.  Latex house paint is an example.  Neither of these will destroy or corrode the styrofoam.  It should be noted though that latex based paints have been known to have some issues with rubber.  So before you combine rubber, styrofoam, and latex paint, make sure the label indicates it is safe for both.

When <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/"">Christmas</a> and <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/seasonal/thanksgiving-fall/"">Thanksgiving</a> arrive, we sell a lot of taper candles.  With heights ranging from 6"" to 24"" and a wide color assortment, for two months of the year, it becomes a major category.  The one question I have gotten countless times is, ""How long will this burn for?""



The answer is simple.  The taper candle rule of thumb is burn time will be approximately one hour per inch of candle.  So, a 12"" taper will burn for approximately 12 hours.  There are many factors that can affect candle burn time such as elevation, air temperature, and humidity.  However, this does work well as a general guideline.

If you have walked through our wire section, you might have noticed the greening pins, sometimes called fern pins.  They have a unique shape and you might wonder what their purpose is?  The answer is quite simple.  Greening pins are used in floral arrangements or other craft projects where you need to attach leaves or moss to either floral foam or styroforam bases.  They can also be used to anchor other materials into the arrangement.  They provide a clean and beautiful finish when used in a floral arrangement.

creepy-crawly-critters,"It's October, the smell of Fall is in the air, the smell of candy is in the air.  It's almost Halloween!  For most young people and many adults I know, this is the coolest holiday of the year.  Scary costumes, crazy and funny costumes, tricks, treats, Haunted Houses, and creepy, crawly critters are in adundance.



Spiders, bats, rats, and similar creatures of horror movies and dark passageways are found at the best and scariest Haunted Houses and parties at Halloween.  In regards to patterns in nature, it would be unlikely to see some of these frightening critters alive and awake on Halloween.  Normally, bats would be hibernating or migrating to a warmer climate in order to live through the winter and many varieties of spiders will have laid eggs and died by the time the weather gets cooler.  Now, of course, in sunny Southern California you never know... (cue favorite horror movie music.)



Most of us prefer to be surrounded by the plastic or paper variety of insects and rodents at our parties...I mean really, who wants to share their Halloween treats with some critter, or anyone else for that matter?  Because of that, I wanted to introduce you to some of the <a title=""Hallo"" href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/seasonal/halloween/"" target=""_blank"">creepy crawly critters we carry here at Shinoda's</a>.  Check out the links to the right for some of our online items and come on into the store to see what else we have.  Remember we only have about 20% of our overall store inventory online.

The coming celebrations of Thanksgiving and Christmas signify the creation of more table centerpieces for all the family dinners and holiday entertaining.  <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/candles/tapers/"">Taper candles</a> are a very popular accent added to these floral arrangements.  Since most table centerpieces are usually made with <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/floral-foam-products/"">floral foam</a>, how do you best secure the candles into it?  There actually is a product created specifically for this purpose.  They are called candle bases.  If you decide on the candle placement first, you can just push the pointed end into the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/floral-foam-products/"">floral foam</a> and your candle will be firmly supported.  Using a  <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/candles/pillars/"">pillar candle</a> instead?  No problem!  Candle bases also comes in sizes for 1.5"", 2"", and 3"" diameter candles.  Also, if you are using a hurricane globe in the arrangement, there is a candle base that you can use with that as well.

tip-of-the-day-mixing-floral-preservative-with-water,"<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/30qt-crystal-clear-powder/2076/""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/7309503042-300x300.jpg"" alt=""30 Quart Floralife Crystal Clear Powder"" title=""30 Quart Floralife Crystal Clear Powder"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1766"" /></a>



If you have used a floral preservative with your cut flowers before,  then you know that they help maximize the life of fresh cut flower arrangements.  Many florists hand out packets of flower food with their arrangements.  If you are like me, you read the directions and pour the packet directly into the vase and mix it with the amount of water it calls for.  This is NOT the correct way to use it!



To understand why requires a brief look into how a floral preservative works.  They extend the life of cut flowers in three primary ways.  First, they contain an antibacterial agent that cleanses the water and interior of the vase.  Bacteria in the water can clog the stem's water intake abilities.  This will cause them to wilt prematurely and die.  Second, they contain a food for the flower to help the bloom continue to process sunlight.  Finally, the floral preservative adjusts the pH balance of the water to optimize water intake.  Allowing for this balancing is the primary reason to mix separately so that the water entering the vase is already pH balanced.



When mixing your floral preservative, use a non-metallic bowl.  Make sure you add the correct amount of preservative to the right volume of water.  Empty the vase holding the cut flowers and add the water mixed with floral preservative.



This should help extend the life of your fresh cut flower arrangement.

Have you ever received a fresh flower table centerpiece and wondered how the stems were secured?  If your centerpiece was well designed, the floral foam should be completely covered.  This is one of the first things floral designers are taught.  Peeling back the layers of the arrangement, you will see the floral foam.  There are several ways to secure the floral foam into the container.  You will probably see some tape crisscrossed in a lattice.  This is the most often used technique to secure it down.  The tape is called bowl tape.  It is waterproof and was meant to be used with fresh flower arrangements.  



Bowl tape is often used for another purpose.  If you receive a fresh flower arrangement in a clear glass vase, when it is time to dispose of the arrangement, you might notice a tape lattice used as a grid to help arrange the flowers at the top of the vase.  The tape lattice is made from bowl tape.



Bowl tape comes in two sizes (1/4"" and 1/2"") and three colors (clear, white, green).

When people think of cellophane, they think of gift baskets and a plastic wrap.  Did you know that cellophane is NOT a derivative of plastic?  It is actually made from cellulose.  Cellulose is a polymer of glucose and contains the chemcial elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.  The word cellophane comes from combining the words cellulose and diaphane (""transparent"").  Since cellophane is made from cellulose, it is 100% biodegradable.  This makes it somewhat of a green solution.  Only ""somewhat"" because the chemical process to produce it is quite toxic.

First time floral design students all learn how to wire their flowers.  The wire can serve many purposes such as helping keep the stems straight as the flower ages or creating a certain aesthetic design line with a flower that wouldn't be achievable any other way.  Since flowers come in so many shapes, sizes, and bloom weights, wire is made available in different thicknesses.  If you use too fine a wire with a particularly large and heavy headed rose, even the wire won't prevent it from drooping or leaning.  So, it is important to buy the right wire thickness.



Wire thickness is designated by what ""gauge"" it is.  We sell wire in gauges ranging from 16 to 28.  One of the first questions usually asked is, ""Which way does it get thicker?""  The answer is simple.  Wire gets thicker the lower the gauge number.  This means that 16 is our thickest and 28 our finest.

tip-of-the-day-whats-the-difference-between-corsage-and-stephanotis-stems,"<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/corsage-stems-x100-green/4233/""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2202941783-300x300.jpg"" alt=""Corsage Stems x100 Green"" title=""Corsage Stems x100 Green"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1865"" /></a>



Have you ever seen the boxes for Corsage and Stephanotis stems and wondered what they were?  I did a little digging and found out both the function and how to use them.



Corsage stems are meant to be used with roses, mini carnations, daisies, dendrobium orchids, and any other hard calyx flowers.  They help extend the life of flowers through a water reservoir that helps to keep them hydrated.  You can also more effectively design using the wire in the stem.  This helps placement and allows you the flexibility of bending the wire in whatever direction you would like.



To use a Corsage stem:

<ol>

<li>Cut flower stem off at calyx.</li>

<li>Dip moisture reservoir in water for ten seconds.</li>

<li>Squeeze flocked wire stem between fingers at base of moisture reservoir and insert into flower.</li>

</ol>



Stephanotis stems use a unique feature of a stephanotis stem.  If you break off the stem of the stephanotis, you are left with a hollow tube leading up into the flower.  Poke out the flower seed and you have a hollow tube.  A stephanotis stem can lengthen the life of the flower because of its water reservoir.  Just like the Corsage stem, you can use the wire in the stephanotis stem to bend the flower to your maximum benefit.



To use a Stephanotis stem:

<ol>

<li>Remove entire stephanotis stem.</li>

<li>Poke out flower seed with stem end.</li>

<li>Dip moisture reservoir in water for ten seconds.</li>

<li>Insert into stephanotis with twisting motion.</li>

</ol>

tip-of-the-day-another-chenille-stem-use,"<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/12-chenille-stem-x100-white/4289/""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2021901001-300x300.jpg"" alt=""12&quot; Chenille Stem x100 White"" title=""12&quot; Chenille Stem x100 White"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1874"" /></a>



Chenille stems have quite a number of uses.  Also called ""pipe cleaners"", they are used in quite a variety of different displays because of their availability in different colors.  We use them in the warehouses quite liberally because of their ability to be color coordinated into vignettes.  We also use them as simple price tag hangars.  Here is another use for them.



Creating a fresh flower arrangement is always a rewarding experience.  From the fragrance of the flowers to the beautiful colors, there are many benefits.  When working with the different types of flowers, there can also be potential problems with the cleanup.  Ever worked with a flower and gotten pollen on a shirt, blouse, or pants?  If you try to simply wipe it off with a paper towel, you quite possibly just rubbed it into the fabric of the clothing and made it impossible to remove.  Instead of a paper towel, grab a chenille stem!  Brush the pollen off with a chenille stem.  It is a much easier way to remove the pollen without rubbing it into the clothing.



Try it out and you will be amazed at how easy the pollen comes off by using a chenille stem.

Here is the situation.  You have burned a votive candle in a holder.  Only needing the candle to be lit for a few hours, you extinguish it.  Letting it cool down, you go to remove the candle only to find that the wax has glued it to the interior of the holder.  If this has ever happened to you, this next tip will save a bit of time in the cleanup and removal of the holder.



Before you place the candle in the holder, spray the interior with a bit of cooking spray.  When you are finished, the candle will slide right out!

In a pinch and need a glass vase to be a certain color?  Spray paint it using a Design Master spray.  Design Master makes a wide assortment of colors and will probably have the color you are looking for.  Just be careful with the vase after the spray paint has been applied.  The paint will scratch very easily.  So, do not place it in a spot that will expose it to a lot of bumps or touches.



Here are a couple of tips when spray painting a glass vase.  If you spray paint the outside, it will have a matte finish.  You can either use a lacquer over it like <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/654-master-shine/1129/"">Master Shine</a> or use a color available in a Glossy finish such as <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/614-design-master-glossy-red/1123/"">Glossy Red</a>, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/626-des-master-glossy-white/1126/"">Glossy White</a>, or <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/625-des-master-glossy-black/1125/"">Glossy Black</a>.  If you spray paint the inside of the vase, it will have a glossy finish because the paint will be seen through the vase.  Just be careful inserting anything into the vase because the paint scratches off very easily.

csfa-top-ten-2011-in-pictures,"Catherine and I made our first trip to the California State Floral Association's annual Top Ten design competition last weekend.  Catherine is actually a board member, so she was there running the silent auction.  I was officially doing 'whatever Catherine needed'.  In between lifting heavy things and locating misplaced heavy things and then lifting them, I was able to catch some of the competition.  I thought it might be cool to present it to you as a photo essay since the best part of the show is seeing the great work the floral designers did.  So without further ado, the 2011 CSFA Top Ten competition!

Before the competition started on Sunday, lots of CSFA members were putting in hard work on Friday and Saturday.  Calif Flora 2011 was not just the Top Ten competition.  There were also classes, certification exams, and design shows, all of which needed materials and preparation.  Catherine and I were helping to set up the 'surprise package' portion of the Top Ten competition.  For those who don't know, I'll put the surprise package challenge in very simple terms: Here's a bag of surprise dry goods, here are some stems, here's a theme, good luck.  Contestants have no idea ahead of time what they're going to get, just that each contestant is going to get the same supplies.  More on that later.  Here's a picture of the surprise bags, all ready to go.

On to Sunday's competition.  The students went first and started with the Designer's Choice competition.  For this portion, the competitors were allowed to bring in whatever foundation they constructed ahead of time, as well as their own dry goods and stems.  Everyone was working on the same theme, which was California Fresh, but each participant had a completely different rig and different interpretation, from simple to incredibly elaborate.  Pictured is one of the more elaborate ones I saw.

After the Designer's Choice competition comes the surprise package.  Here's where the little red bags we helped assemble come into play.  The surprise package could not be more different than the open competition, where you could have planned your design for months.  The last thing I want to hear when I'm competing for something is 'surprise', but the students seemed to be having fun, and even Tony Alvarez pointed out how relaxed everyone was.

The students created some amazing designs in both parts of the competition.  I think the most nerve-wracking part had to be when you walked your design over to the table to be judged.  I would have been thinking, 'Don't drop it, don't drop it, don't drop it', the whole time.  Thankfully, there were no such disasters.  After all of the designs had been moved, I sneaked in to take some pictures.  I felt like I was doing some real journalism when I was asked to leave and said in my most official sounding voice, 'I just need to take these pictures for some of the board members'.  That was kinda true.  Spoiler alert: #8 was the student winner.

For the surprise package portion of Top Ten, we had a legitimate surprise in store for the competitors.  We got our hands on a pretty new product called, 'Stackables', which are the white containers you can see in front of the participants.  They're stackable containers that can be used in a variety of ways.  Some of the designers looked at them in the same way you might look at a Martian or a dragon or something that you couldn't even believe you were actually seeing.  Others had an immediate idea and made it the central container of their design.  As it did with the students, the surprise package reminds us that the world don't move to the beat of just one drum.

This is what everyone was competing for.  That and some money ($500 for first!), a gift certificate to Shinoda Design Center, and an entry into the Sylvia Cup, which is a national design competition.  Not bad for 1.5 hours of work.  Instead of being merciful and telling everyone who won shortly after the competition, all of the designers had to wait until the end of the day before the big announcement.  Brutal.

Once again I slipped into the judging area, although this time I was not asked to go someplace else.  A design that immediately caught my attention was the one I called 'Bizarro California'.  The entire time she was working on it on-stage, it was facing her, so it looked like California was backward.  Then when it was put on display, it was backwards if you were looking at it from the spectator area.  Apparently it did not only catch my eye, as this turned out to be the winning entry, crafted by Mai Lakia Chhim.  Her surprise package entry wasn't too shabby either.



Congratulations to all the participants, and to all the CSFA board members, sponsors, and volunteers who made the event such a success.  See you next year!

...Maybe eating candy from a mummy's head?  Halloween is loved by many because it's spooky, because you get to be someone else for a night, and because you are allowed to scare the wits out of the neighborhood.



What goes better with Halloween gatherings than drinking your hot cocoa from a skull mug or grabbing some fruit from a platter but getting an eyeball instead?  Not only do your guests get a kick out of it but you can choose to use your Halloween tableware anytime during the year, just to keep your friends guessing.



Many of our mugs and candy bowls have assorted designs.  Stop by the store to see the varieties above and check out some of your online choices (to the right).  Always be sure to check if your mug or tableware item is food-safe, read our <a title=""Tip of the Day: Do we sell food-safe products?"" href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/2011/09/27/tip-of-the-day-do-we-sell-food-safe-products/"" target=""_blank"">food-safe blog for more information.</a>



Don't forget to stop by the grocery store for some hot cocoa mix, hot apple cider, or other favorite hot fall drinks!"

For another month, our Halloween products will be on display.  During this last part of the year, we have an increase in the amount of dried products we sell.  In particular, pinecones are something that customers look for on a regular basis.  Where are they in the online store?

Have you ever been on an event site and pulled out your ribbon to make a bow and found that it had gotten crushed and wrinkled during transport?  Caught without an iron, how can you possibly get the wrinkles out?  Here is a quick tip.



First, find a lamp with a traditional light bulb.  Pull the shade off.  Hold the ribbon taut.  Then run it over the light bulb until it straightens.  The heat of the light bulb will act like an iron.  Just make sure the light bulb is not too hot or it will singe the ribbon.  How do you gauge the heat of the light bulb?  The rule of thumb is that the light bulb should be on for less then five minutes.  If the light bulb has been on for more then five minutes, it will most likely singe the ribbon or actually cause it to burn.  Finding an unused lamp would be best.

Yesterday, as I was working in the San Diego warehouse, the phone rang and I answered.  The person on the line had never been into one of our warehouses, had just registered online, and wanted to know if that was everything we carried.  It is a great question and one I was not expecting!  For over seventeen years, I have run the San Diego facility.  Since our online store is an effort of the last couple of years, I did not realize I was working under the assumption that online shoppers had been into one of our warehouses before.  With the rise of online commerce and the increased use of our online store, more and more of our customers will never see the inside of our warehouse.



Back to my customer and the question, we have a little more then 12,000 listed online now.  In the warehouses, we have over <strong>60,000</strong> items in our system.  We currently estimate between thirty and thirty five thousand active items between both warehouses.  That means we have between 30% to 40% of our items online.  Since we are constantly looking for the best deals and purchase many closeout items, the warehouse will probably always have items that we cannot list online because we received such small quantities.  So, to answer the question more directly, there is MUCH more in the warehouses then online.



If you have never been into one of the warehouses, you are really missing out!  We pride ourselves on our display work and hope to give you ideas and insights on color and trends with the newest products.  To get a better idea of what a warehouse looks like, take a look at our published pictures in our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/tag/gallery/"">website galleries</a> or <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/media/albums/?id=137088893000714"">Facebook</a>.

I was going over our visitor log and noticed there were quite a few searches for birds and birdhouses.  To make it easier for everyone, I decided to make that my next Online Shopping Tip.  First, let me discuss how certain themes are categorized.  If you are looking for holiday merchandise (<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/halloween/"">Halloween</a>, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/seasonal/thanksgiving-fall/"">Thanksgiving</a>, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/seasonal/easter/"">Easter</a>), they are located in the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/seasonal/"">Seasonal</a> section under <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/store/"">Shop Shinoda's</a>.  In an effort to make things easier to find, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/"">Christmas</a> is considered its own category and we will be bringing the upcoming holiday to the main list like <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/halloween/"">Halloween</a> is now.  Any non-holiday themes (such as <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/beach-nautical/"">Beach & Nautical</a>, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/sports/"">Sports</a>, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/movies/"">Movies</a>, and <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/decor-display/religious/"">Religious</a>) have been placed into <a href=""<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/store/"">Decor & Display</a>.

As usual, the Tip of the Day comes courtesy of a customer question.  They wanted to know how long a standard string of Christmas lights should last before a bulb burns out.  For this question, I contacted one of our main vendors.  I was told that a standard string of Christmas lights whether it be a 50 light set or 100 light set should be able to last 1000 hours.  We are talking about AC powered strands of light only.  So, do not apply this to any kind of battery powered light or strands with different types of bulbs such as LED, C9, or fiber optics.

We sell a lot of raffia.  Walking down the aisle in one of our warehouses, there is a large selection of color and multiple types.  There is even the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/search/wraphia-ii/"">Wraphia II</a> line of synthetically produced raffia.  The other day, I was working in the warehouse.  A customer brought me two different types of raffia and asked me the difference.  See the pictures below:



This is treated raffia:



<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/raffia-natural-12oz/4204/""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/1809610011-300x300.jpg"" alt=""Treated Raffia Natural 12oz"" title=""Treated Raffia Natural 12oz"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2080"" /></a>



This is untreated raffia:



<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/8oz-raffia-untreated-natural/4205/""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/1809610022-300x300.jpg"" alt=""8oz Raffia Untreated Natural"" title=""8oz Raffia Untreated Natural"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2083"" /></a>



Treated raffia has a glycerine like coating.  This makes it feel and act more like a plastic twine.  It can be knotted and twisted.  Due to the coating, treated raffia can be pretty limp.  It lacks the fullness and body that untreated raffia has.



Untreated raffia feels much more woody.  Without the coating, the raffia cannot be treated too roughly or it will crack and even break.  It can still be shaped and wrapped around things.  It just cannot be done with as much brute power.  However, this lack of treatment provides it with more natural body.

Have you seen or heard the term ""pin frog"" before?  I have seen them around the warehouse and get asked for them frequently.  So, I decided to see exactly what their purpose was.  I would have never been able to predict how interesting the topic became.



It all starts with the name ""pin frog"".  Why are they called frogs?  Looking in the dictionary, if you look at the extended definitions of the word ""frog"", one of them is actually floral holder.  The origin of this definition is not listed.  To look into the origins of the term, you have to travel back to the 16th century when the first references of pin frog originate.  The floral definition of frog as a ""floral holder"" must originate from this time period.  It is thought that it might be in reference to how a pin frog sits on the bottom of the water in a vase like a frog.



Moving forward in time, pin frogs became a staple to Ikebana type of work.  It is probably because of their two main functions.  First, pin frogs are heavy to provide an anchor to a vase.  Have you ever worked with really top heavy flowers and not been able to stabilize the vase?  The trick is to add enough weight to the base of the vase to enable it to stay upright.  The weight of the pin frog can be adjusted by working with bigger or smaller ones, as needed.  The second function of the pin frogs is to provide a way to hold flowers upright without using the vase walls.  Many Ikebana style arrangements feature shallow walled vases.  If you place a pin frog in the vase and then push the stems into the pins, the flower will be held up and the weight of the pin frog will keep the flower from tipping.



Are you looking for pin frogs?  We have them under the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/wire-products/"">Wire Products</a> in the <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/"">Floral Supplies</a> category.  There is currently only one size listed online.  However, we carry many more sizes in the warehouses and we should be listing the other sizes in the next couple of weeks.

""How many yards of ribbon do I need to purchase to make 10 bows?""



That is a question I have heard a multitude of times in the warehouse.  There really is not a good objective answer for it since it will involve the number of bow loops involved, the length you will make each loop, the number of tails you will be running off the bow, and the length of those tails.  I can give you a general guideline with a bow built with our description.

I have written about cellophane in the past.  Since it comes in different widths, thicknesses, and colors, cellophane is a versatile product that can be used for a wide variety of purposes.  Sometimes when someone asks me a question about a new use, I have to do some research to figure out if it is feasible or not.  The most recent question was, ""Can I use cellophane to change a light bulbs color?""



The answer is both yes and no.  This is because of the heat a light bulb emits.  When a light bulb has been on for more then five minutes, it starts to radiate enough heat to singe even ribbon.  If you need to apply the color to the light bulb directly, the answer is no.  You cannot use cellophane to change the color.  A better answer is something called lighting gel or a transparent paint that can be used on light bulbs.  If you are planning on creating something like a lamp shade or color wheel and you place the cellophane at a distance far enough to dissipate the heat, the answer is yes.

Cinnamon sticks are a staple of our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/other-silks-drieds/dried-products/"">Dried Products</a> section.  Do you know just how versatile they are?  Here is a list of a few ways you can use them around your home.



<ul>

<li>It can be used as a stovetop potpourri.  Place a pot of water or cider on the stove and add 4-5 sticks.  Let it simmer and replace fluid as necessary.  This will fill your house with a lovely fragrance.</li>



<li>It can be used as dry potpourri as well.  Just take a bowl, place it on a table that you want refreshed, and add 4-5 cinammon sticks.  It is a quick and simple room deodorizer.</li>



<li>It can be used in Christmas wreath, garland, or tree decoration.  Not only does it add a bit of color to your creation, it will create a fragrance.</li>



<li>It can be used as an insect repellant.  Add a few sticks into your household cleaner before wiping down your kitchen, cabinets, or floor.  The scent of the cinammon will act as an insect repellant</li>

<li>It can also be used in closets as a moth repellant.  Take 4-5 cinammon sticks and break them up.  Combine the broken up sticks with a half cup of black peppercorns and a half cup of whole cloves.  Place this mix into a small bag that can be aerated (such as a tea bag or chiffon fabric bag), tie up, and hang in your closet.</li>

tip-of-the-day-floral-designer-glue-of-choice,"[nggallery id=38]



&nbsp;

Have you been to one of our floral design shows? If you have, you might have noticed the designers using what looks like a frying pan. When they insert a stem into styrofoam or want to glue something into place in an arrangement, they dip the item or stem into the pan and place it into the arrangement. What are they doing?



To start, the pan is no ordinary pan. It is an electrically powered pan that heats a product called pan glue. After the pan has heated up and melted the glue, it stays in a liquid state until the pan is turned off. If you will be using a lot of glue, it offers the advantage of being able to use both hands unlike a glue gun. Also with a glue gun, you have to pull the trigger to get usable glue. If you need precise placement of a small amount of glue to an item that cannot be dipped into the pan, you will still need to have a glue gun to do that. The glue pan can be pretty versatile but cannot replace all the functions of a good glue gun. So, do not throw away your glue gun if you get a glue pan.

See the product listed above?  It is an aluminum flat wire.  It looks very basic and boring.  If you use it correctly, the accents you can create are only limited by your imagination.  The aluminum wire comes in a variety of colors.  It also comes in the more traditional circular wire.  Take a look to the right at the related products and you will see the different types and colors that are available.



Still unconvinced?  Take a look at this gallery of floral arrangments using the aluminum wire from the San Diego Spring-Wedding Show.

Mitsumata is a popular dried branch used more often during the Fall and Christmas seasons.  It is similar to manzanita and is used because of the number of branches it has.  These branches are useful in hanging ornaments or other decorations.  Mitsumata has a surprising feature that makes it even easier to use then manzanita.  If you take the branch, and soak it in water for a few hours, the main branch stems become pliable and you can shape them.  Make sure you do so slowly and only after having been soaked for several hours.  Allow them to dry and they will firm right up and become rigid again.

Today, when I started to think about the Tip of the Day, my brain was not working right and I could not think of anything. So, I called the Santa Ana warehouse for suggestions. The first question that I was asked was, ""How much ribbon do you need to decorate a Christmas tree?"" I have been asked this many times before and my mental logjam was broken.



This was not an easy answer to come by. Most companies and most designers will tell you that the number can be very different. It all depends on how tightly or loosely you wrap the ribbon and how much spacing you put between the wraps. The number can vary quite widely. The answer came from moving to a different product. I found some recommendations for the amount of Christmas garland decorations to place on a Christmas Tree. These are the general recommendations of where to start:

<table width=""250"" border=""0"" align=""center"">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td align=""center"">Tree Height</td>

<td align=""center"">Amount of Ribbon</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>4' - 5'</td>

<td>40 feet - 55 feet</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>6' - 6.5'</td>

<td>70 feet - 75 feet</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>7' - 7.5'</td>

<td>84 feet - 98 feet</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>8' - 9'</td>

<td>120 feet - 150 feet</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

Remember, these are generalized suggestions. You can use these as a guide on how much ribbon to start with. These guides also apply to fabric or netting used as garland in a tree.

Since we have moved into November, many of the upcoming Tips of the Day will involve Christmas. Today's tip is one of the most fundamental to decorating for Christmas. How many ornaments do you need to purchase to decorate your Christmas tree? As a general guide, there are two rules to follow. For a tree up to nine feet, use ten ornaments per foot. If the tree is over nine feet, use between twelve to sixteen ornaments per foot. In a table, it would look like this:

<table width=""250"" border=""0"" align=""center"">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td align=""center"">Tree Height</td>

<td align=""center"">Number of Ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>5'</td>

<td>50 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>6'</td>

<td>60 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>7'</td>

<td>70 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>8'</td>

<td>80 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>9'</td>

<td>90 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>10'</td>

<td>120 - 160 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>12'</td>

<td>144 - 192 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>14'</td>

<td>168 - 224 ornaments</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

Remember, these are general guidelines on where to start. Depending on the size of the ornaments selected and the desired density of the placement, this could vary by a great deal.

I am born and raised in Southern California.  That means I have never lived in a place that it regularly snowed each year, let alone snowed at all.  So, the only thing Winter means to me is that I might not be able to wear flip flops and shorts everyday.  For those that come from snowy climates, there are things that happen during the Winter months that are missed.  One such thing is crystallized, frosty windows during Christmas.  How can you artificially create them?



If you go down our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/paints-polishes/"">Spray Paint</a> section, you will find a product called <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/800-crystal-frost-6oz-spray/1205/"">Crystal Frost</a>.  You can use the spray to accent windows, mirrors, ornaments, or vases.  It can also be sprayed into votive cups and hurricane globes for a frosty candlelight glow.

customer-question-of-the-day-are-all-of-our-christmas-products-here,"Since we have been taking many calls in the warehouses about this, I was asked to write a blog answering the question, ""Are all of our Christmas products here?""



We have about 98% of our products now.  There will be a little bit more dribbling onto our shelves but there are no shipments left of any significant size for us to stock.  In fact, in the next couple of weeks, we expect to start stocking out of the most popular items.  Once we start to run out of Christmas items across both warehouses, it will not be until next year that we receive new shipments of them.  With some of the items that we do not directly import, we will not know item availability for next year until March.  So, for the widest selection, the first two weeks of November is probably the best time to shop us.  After that, the large professional installations start swallowing up huge amounts of merchandise with single orders.



If you have not been into the warehouses this season, here are a few pictures I just took in the San Diego Warehouse.  You can also go onto <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/media/albums/?id=137088893000714"">Facebook</a> or into our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/tag/gallery/"">Website Galleries</a> to get a look at this season's endcaps and pictures from around the warehouse.



Hope this helps!

Thanksgiving and Christmas are creeping closer.  Time to get out your decorations!  If you are hosting a dinner for either holiday, you will be starting to organize how you will be decorating.  That is where the Tip of the Day comes in.  With all the garlands for both Fall and Christmas, we get asked how to attach them to a table.  Here are three methods.



If you are setting up banquet tables that can sustain some light damage, you can use tacks.  Start by placing your tablecloth onto the table.  Make sure you have it positioned exactly as you want it.  Start placing your garland around the table.  Push a tack into the area and wrap some fishing line around the tack and the garland.  Use the tack to secure the garland to the area.  If the garland is heavy, you will have to use multiple tacks and fishing line to hold it.  Continue placing tacks every 18"" if you are running garland around the table.  You might have to place more tacks if your garland it heavy.  If you are just draping it, you can place the tacks as necessary to create the desired effect.



If you do not want to damage the table, you can use safety pins and fishing line to accomplish the same effect.  Like the tacks, you will have to use more if the garland is heavy.



If you do not want to damage the table or the tablecloth, the last way is to use tablecloth clips.  Unfortunately, we do not sell these.  I did a Google search and found many sources.  If you have trouble finding them, see <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS431US431&gcx=w&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=tablecloth+clips"">my search results</a>.  The tablecloth clips are pretty self explanatory to use.  You put the tablecloth on and then clamp the clips into place.  To secure the garland, take some wire and wrap them through the clamp and around the garland.  Like the tacks and safety pins, a heavy garland will require more clips.

This next Tip of the Day seems quite obvious.  However, I cannot tell you how many times I have spoken to frustrated customers during their checkout or when processing an exchange.  At this time of year, we sell a lot of Christmas light sets.  One simple step can save you a lot of time and frustration.



<strong>Check to make sure your light set works before installing them!</strong>



Depending on how you install them into your Christmas <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/trees/"">tree</a>, <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/pine-wreaths-accessories/"">wreath</a>, or <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/pine-garlands/"">garland</a>, it can be both time consuming and really frustrating to have to take them out and replace them.  Some people end up trying to find the problem.  If you have ever had a set go out, you will know that trying to find the bad bulb, connection, or fuse is not a pleasant experience.  This is much easier to accomplish if the light set has not been installed and is in front of you.  Better yet, you can take them back as defective.  If you have purchased them from us, just bring them back in a timely manner and we will exchange them for you.  Timely manner means within a month or two.  We will not be able to replace lights that were purchased from another season and brought out to reuse.

Christmas and Thanksgiving bring with them an increase in the amount of gift baskets everyone receives.  Shrinkwrap is frequently used to wrap these baskets.  If you are thinking of creating one, or using shrinkwrap for other purposes, this tip was created to give you some pointers and a better understanding of it.



Before we get started, a brief lesson on what shrinkwrap is and how it works are required.  Shrinkwrap is a polymer.  When it is created into a sheet, the polymer is stretched and elongated.  To understand this, visualize a tangled mess of string.  That tangled mess represents the shrinkwrap in its natural state.  To create shrinkwrap, imagine the strings pulled out of the mess until they are stretched into a straight line one by one.  When the roll is created, all the strings have been pulled apart and laid out in straight rows.  When you apply heat, the molecules become active and try to resume their natural state.  This is why shrinkwrap shrinks!  It goes from being like pulled string back to a tangled mess.  This is also why shrinkwrap is actually stronger after heat has been applied.



When you apply heat to shrinkwrap, you can purchase a shrinkwrap gun or a good hair dryer will do the trick.  Apply the heat with at least a six inch distance from gun to shrinkwrap.  Try to apply heat to all parts of the shrinkwrap.  This will ensure a uniform strength around the item you are wrapping.  Remember, shrinkwrap that has had heat applied to it is stronger.  This will ensure that you have a uniform strength of wrapping around the object.



Shrinkwrap is categorized with our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/cellophane/"">Cellophane</a>.  See our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/floral-supplies/cellophane/"">Cellophane</a> products.

When I am walking around the warehouse, customers will ask me questions.  I am always surprised at how I cannot answer even some of the most simple questions.  I was recently asked, ""What's the difference between indoor and outdoor Christmas light sets?""



To get the best answer, I searched online for a bit.  I opened five different posts and saw five different answers.  So, I decided to call our main source for Christmas lights and see what they had to say.  I was told that there is not a difference.  UL does not have a different quality standard to call a Christmas light set indoor versus outdoor.  They label the sets based on what they think customers primary use is.  The only time an indoor/outdoor rating really differentiates a product is when there is a battery attached or a control box.  The wiring in the battery case and the control box will be insulated differently based on an indoor or outdoor usage.  For those of you unfamiliar with Christmas light control boxes, they are used when a light set can do multiple functions such as twinkle, dim, flash, and stay steady.  Usually there is a control box with a button that allows you to control these functions.



Keep in mind we are only discussing a standard Christmas set of lights.  This tip does not apply to the other bulb sizes or types like LED.

I walked her to our spray paint section and pointed out a can that said Holiday Snow Premium Snow Flock.  This is the product you use to add snow flocking to.

Today, I was walking around the warehouse helping customers.  Usually, this is the best way for me to come up with ideas for the Tip of the Day.  I was not disappointed.  By helping a customer, I was asked a question that led to this Tip of the Day.



The customer told me that she wanted a different look for her Christmas tree this year.  She normally did things the traditional way with some lights, ornaments, and tinsel garland.  Her children had grown and this year it was going to be HER tree.  We walked over to the display area and I showed her some of our decorated trees to help give her some ideas.  She immediately became captivated by all of our glittered netting.  We have a couple of different kinds and colors.  If you have never used it before, it is easy to use.  Take a look at the gallery and you will see a couple of different ways we have used it.  We have also used it to spruce up some Christmas garlands.  It can be used as a garland, you can make a bow out of it, or tie it off every so often and create a kind of draping with it.  Most of our netting is made from a monofilament line similar to fishing line that creates some body to it as well.

First, let me say that there is no exact number for the lights that should go on a Christmas tree.  This is due to the variability in how bright someone wants the tree, how closely or far apart they want the differing level of lights to be, how tightly or loosely they place the strands, and the type of tree itself.



The following recommendations are very loose places to start and are  generalized for the average Christmas tree.

sending-someone-to-shop-for-you-give-them-a-shinoda-id-card,"During the past week, we have had some dissatisfied customers because they sent people to purchase under their Shinoda account and we had to turn them away.  The people sent did not have a Shinoda card nor were they listed as an authorized buyer.  Our only method of verifying them is to call the phone number listed in our system that you provided when you registered.  Also, to look up your account, we need either the business name or phone number you registered with.  Our computer system does not allow for us to look up a customer by name.  Oftentimes, the person trying to purchase does not know either the account holder's business name or phone number.  Under these circumstances, we cannot look up the account to attempt the verification call.  If we cannot verify that the person is being authorized, we must turn them away.  We have a duty to protect the resale licenses entrusted to us and the purchases that get rung through our system.



There have been a few times where customers try to hand us their cellphone for the verification.  We cannot accept this form of verification since we have no way of authenticating who is on the phone.  Our only way of ensuring that a correct authorization occurs is by us calling the number provided by the account holder.  We do this to provide security to our accounts and the resale numbers you have entrusted with us.



Knowing this limitation and to help provide you with maximum access, we will provide as many Shinoda ID cards as you like.  Click <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/faq/#shinodacard"">here</a> if you would like to obtain more cards.

Have you had the opportunity to work with either a Submersible Tea Light or a Submersible Flora Lyte?  When combined with a floral arrangement in a glass vase, they can provide quite an effect.  Throw some water beads into a vase with a submersible and you have a custom look that is not often seen.  The other day, a customer asked, ""How long do the batteries last in a submersible?""



For both kinds of submersible, the answer is between 36-48 hours.  They can be completely submerged in water.  If you have never worked with them before, after about three to six hours, the Flora Lytes start to leak dye into the water.  If you are using a glass vase, the dye will not discolor the vase.

I have taken a few phone calls from frustrated customers that are having difficulty with our site search.  Here is a trick that might produce different search results.  It takes advantage of a little known feature that Google provides.  First, go to www.google.com.  In the Google Search bar, type in ""site:www.shinodadesigncenter.net"" (do not include the quotation marks).  Without hitting enter, type in the item you are searching for.  For example, if you were searching for abaca garland, you would type in ""site:www.shinodadesigncenter.net abaca garland"" (again, do not include the quotation marks).  After entering the item, hit the enter key.  This will use Google to search the pages they have indexed for our site.  Google has not indexed every page of our site.  So, there may be some products that do not appear in their searches.

During the last couple of weeks, I have had several conversations with customers about the height of the Christmas tree they should buy.  They have measured out the height of the ceiling and are trying to pick out a tree that will fill the area.  The first question I ask is always, ""How tall of a tree topper do you plan to put on your tree?""



Tree toppers are often considered the heart and soul of Christmas Tree decoration because many people feel they define the tree.  When putting on a tree topper, usually they are tall.  Plus, as the tree gets taller, the tree topper generally does as well to maintain a ratio of tree topper to tree height.  When deciding on how tall a tree the ceiling will allow, many people overlook the added height of the tree topper.  The other day, a customer told me her ceiling was 12'3"".  She asked if a 12' tree would fit.  I told her that it would but not if she planned on using a tree topper.  She had completely forgotten that her tree topper was 10"" high and wouldn't fit under her ceiling.  She ended up buying a 10' Christmas tree instead.

With Black Friday this week, the final countdown to Christmas decorating is coming.  Major commercial installations will happen this week and most families install their Christmas trees next weekend.  We often get asked, ""How busy are you on Black Friday?""



The answer surprises most of our customers.  We are usually quite dead from our 8am opening time until around 11am or noon.  Most people are shopping the stores that have big Black Friday sales.  We usually do not start to get busy until after the first rush to the big retailers and people have gone home to empty out their cars and take a nap.  During that afternoon and over the weekend, we are extremely busy.  It is one of the two busiest weekends of the year.



If you want to take advantage of the lull in warehouse activity, come to one of our warehouses between 8am and 11am and you will be surprised at the low level of activity for Black Friday.  Many of our customers know that this is the last time you will be able to walk into the warehouses without seeing a large crowd.

Pretty cool, right?  Since I promised 4 steps, I'm going to do a photo gallery of them, just to prove it to you.  So here goes.



<strong>Step 1: Open the box</strong>

Everything you need is in the box, including the cleverly folded tree, and is packed nicely in styrofoam (it's a great place  to store the tree when you're not using it as an aside).  [caption id=""attachment_2854"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""450"" caption=""One Tree in a box!""]<img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSCN0420.png"" alt=""Acrylic Tree In Box"" title=""Acrylic Tree In Box"" width=""450"" height=""600"" class=""size-full wp-image-2854"" />[/caption]



<strong>Step 2: Remove the tree</strong>

As soon as you take the tree out, it will literally start setting itself up.  Most of the branches will unfold by themselves.  Gently extend the branches that haven't unfolded already, and your tree will be ready for decorations.

You get 12 ornaments.  For the price of the tree, $39.95, the 12 ornaments you get is a steal.  The tree is a bonus.  Even if you never open the tree or do anything with it, you get 12 great ornaments for any purpose you want.  Here's what our faithful tree looks like all decked out.

<strong>Step 4: Impress friends, mothers-in-law, etc.</strong>

For the finale, find a window, counter, table, desk, or anywhere a tree like this could sit and impress your friends and family.  Since everyone was busy at the store, I was left to impress myself.  I was pretty taken aback by what I had made.

That's all there is to it.  You can grab one of these for $39.95 plus tax (where applicable) and shipping.  It's simple to do, and you can still order it with plenty of time to display it before the big day.



See you around the store!

Sorry about the delay in posting a new tip. We have been getting crushed in the warehouse and I have spent quite a bit of time cashiering. I have been diligently listening to customer questions but they have all been related to past tips. Someone brought up some gold bullion and it reminded me of something I learned about it.



Gold bullion is a product that has been around for a while. When I first started, I would look at it and wonder what it was for. At one of our floral design shows, I watched and listened as a designer worked with it and was commentating on it. Typically, bullion comes in the form of the picture above. What I did not see or realize is that it is meant to be pulled apart and stretched. This turns it into a fine wire. You can see it used in the gallery below. Once pulled apart, the bullion can be used as an accent, a wire tie, or to provide a light structure for an arrangement.

customer-question-of-the-day-are-we-getting-any-more-christmas-products,"Since I have been cashiering so much this week, some of our longtime customers recognize me, come right over, and ask me interesting questions.  Yesterday, one of them asked me, ""Are all of your Christmas products here?""



We have landed pretty much everything now.  However, during the month of November, we landed several quite large closeout orders that we are struggling to process.  Due to the size of the loads, everything was landed in our Santa Ana warehouse.  At the last check, there were 59 pallets of merchandise headed to San Diego alone.  If the San Diego portion of the load was 59 pallets, that means Santa Ana received well over 150 pallets total.  Both warehouses are working on getting the merchandise onto the sales floor.  However, there is a large portion that will not make it this season and will have to wait until next year.



So, we are still in the process of putting out new Christmas merchandise on a daily basis.  You will not see a whole new line of Christmas products if you re-visit us.  However, you just might find some products that are new.



If you have not been into the warehouses this season, take a look at our galleries on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/media/albums/?id=137088893000714"">Facebook</a> or our <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/tag/gallery/"">Website Galleries</a> to get a look at this season's endcaps and pictures from around the warehouse.

This past Monday, I placed a large order and we should see it sometime mid next week.



For San Diego customers interested in purchasing some, it should be hitting our shelves next week on Wednesday or Thursday.  If you will be visiting the warehouse to purchase some, please call in advance to make sure it has arrived.  I would hate for you to drive in and not be able to purchase any.



For Santa Ana customers, we are hoping to land it before Thursday.  As long as we do, it should arrive in Santa Ana on Friday and make its way to the shelves that same day.  Again, if you will be visiting the warehouse to purchase some, please call in advance to make sure it has arrived.

During the month of November, I have spent a growing percentage of my time cashiering. This gives me a completely different perspective on warehouse operations and provides the perfect opportunity to see what kinds of merchandise are being purchased. Over the last month, it has become apparent how strongly the candy colors continue to sell. I have also noticed strong sales in our peppermint lines, gingerbread lines, and just about anything else that has to do with the candy, food, or cupcake themes.



I had noticed the trend earlier in the month and even wrote ""<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/2011/11/13/online-shopping-tip-where-are-our-peppermint-and-gingerbread-christmas-items/"">Online Shopping Tip: Where are our Peppermint and Gingerbread Christmas Items</a>"".

Unfortunately, I received an email stating that the shipment had been delayed from last Wednesday to today.  I apologize if this causes any inconvenience.  I am extremely disappointed by the vendor's delay in notifying me after an email on 11/30 that stated it was shipping that day.



The revised ETA for the netting is now Monday 12/12 in the San Diego warehouse.  Due to the timing of our warehouse truck exchange, Santa Ana will most likely get their's on 12/15 and it should hit the floor by 12/16.  Again, we are subject to any changes the trucking company might place on this order.  If I hear of any other delays, I will write it up in the blog again.  Just to be safe, please call before coming into the warehouse to make sure we have landed the order.



Again, I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

With the holiday decorating season fully under way and the popularity of glittered items, when it comes time to take it all down, how do you clean up all the leftover glitter?  Depending on the type of floor surface, here are a couple of suggestions.



<strong>Carpet</strong>



If you have a large pile of glitter, it is best to start with a shop vac or vacuum attachment to lift out any piles.  Do not push on the pile.  This will only mash it into the carpet making further cleanup more difficult.  Instead, let the attachement pull it up.  If there is leftover glitter or you only have a small amount to cleanup, use masking tape to pick up the rest.  Place some masking tape with sticky side facing out around your hand, and dab the carpet where the glitter is.  Again, do not push too much on the glitter as this might cause it to sink into the carpet.  Just lightly dab at it until all the glitter has been removed.  Masking tape works best since it is designed to not leave adhesive residue behind.  Using duck tape or other forms of tape may cause a residue to be left behind on the carpet.



<strong>Tile and Wood</strong>



If you have a large pile of glitter, use a shop vac or vacuum attachment to pick up the main pile.  After the main pile of glitter is gone, you can use a wet rag to pickup the rest.  If the glitter is stubborn and cannot be removed with the wet rag, you can use masking tape to pickup the final remnants.

I thought I would continue on with the clean up theme today.  Yesterday's tip ""<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/2011/12/05/tip-of-the-day-how-do-i-clean-up-glitter/"">Tip of the Day: How do I clean up glitter?</a>"", started with the leftover glitter.  Today, we will move on to the snow flocking and any styrofoam that was left behind.  We have sold quite a bit of crushed styrofoam that is used as artificial snow.  Hopefully, this will make the cleanup a little more painless.



The main problem when cleaning up styrofoam and snow flocking is air current created in trying to pick it up and the fact that they produce quite a bit of static electricity.  The static electricity is what can cause it to just seemingly blow away as you try to wipe it up especially when using a cotton rag.  How can you kill both of these birds with one stone?  Use <a href=""http://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng.do?search_query=Anti+Static+Spray"">anti-static spray</a>.  The link sends you to Walmart but it is pretty commonly available.



To use the anti-static spray, first spray a light layer on the snow flocking/styrofoam.  The cleanup is most easily accompished with a shop vac or a vacuum that allows for attachements.  On the tip of the shop vac or attachment, spray some of the anti-static spray.  Try not to use the normal vacuuming motion of forward and back.  Instead, dab at the piles of styrofoam from above.  This will slow you down but ultimately help you to cleanup a greater amount.

tip-of-the-day-a-couple-of-helpful-suggestions-for-christmas-tree-decorating,"This upcoming weekend I will be putting up my personal Christmas tree.  Over the years, I have learned a couple of best practices that I thought I would share with everyone.



First, if you plan on using a tree topper, put the tree topper on first!  This is counter-intuitive to how many people decorate their tree.  The reason for placing the tree topper first is to lessen the risk of knocking off or breaking ornaments while attempting to put the tree topper on.  Since the degree of difficulty in placing the tree topper goes up with the height of the tree, this becomes even more important with trees over ten feet in height.



Second, wrap any tree garland immediately after the tree topper is set.  Again, this is for the same reason.  If you place it before the ornaments go on, there is less risk of knocking off or breaking ornaments while wrapping the garland around the tree.

tip-of-the-day-another-common-sense-tip-for-christmas-lights,"Back in early November, I wrote the original ""<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/2011/11/07/tip-of-the-day-christmas-lights/"">Tip of the Day:  Common Sense Tip for Christmas Lights</a>"".  Today, after hearing a story about a Santa Ana warehouse employee, I decided to expand on this tip.



The Santa Ana employee had purchased a lit tree from us.  She got home, placed the tree, decorated it, and then plugged it into the wall.  Unfortunately, none of the lights were working.  After trying to fix the lights, it was determined that the tree was defective.  To bring it back to us, not only did the tree need to be taken down, all of the ornaments had to be removed as well.



So, to expand on this tip of the day:



From the original tip:



<strong>Check to make sure your light set works before installing them!</strong>



Add to this:



<strong>If you have purchased a pre-lit garland, tree, or wreath, check to make sure the lights work before you start decorating the item.</strong>

online-sale-free-shipping-when-you-order-a-snowfall-light-bundle,"As you can see, we spruced the front page up, including adding our first video.  We're almost all grown up now!



We decided to add a video for the Snowfall lights because a picture does not really do them justice.  When you come into the store, where the lights are really popular, you can see them in action and get a real feel for what you can do with them.  So now you can see the 'snowfall' effect of the lights and start envisioning how you might use them.  In case you missed it, here it is:

To kickstart your creative process, we're giving you free ground shipping* on our, 'I'll take it' special on the front page.  You just have to order one of the main sets and one of the 5 light expansion sets.  That will give you 10 total lights for your next winter design project.  So take advantage of this offer while it lasts.  Like I said, they're very popular in the store, so our supplies are limited.



See you around the web store!

customer-question-of-the-day-when-will-all-the-spring-merchandise-be-here,"With Christmas behind us, we are now starting the Spring switchover in the warehouses.  Between both warehouses, that means we will be changing over 50 endcaps and the assorted merchandising we do.  Knowing that this has started, a customer asked me the other day, ""When will all the Spring merchandise be here?""



Right now, we are putting back out Spring merchandise that we held over from last year.  During 2011, we receive a steady trickle of merchandise that we purchase on closeout.  This will be more prominently displayed now.  We also placed orders during the Summer of last year for new Spring products.  Those orders have just started to land.  We receive the vast majority before the end of January.  If I had to put a percentage estimate on it, I would say that we receive roughly 70% of our Spring merchandise by the end of January.  We will probably receive another 20% in February.  In March, we will receive roughly the last 10% with a very small trickle in April.  By April, we have pretty much received everything except the closeouts we continue to purchase.  By late May and June, we start receiving our initial Christmas loads and begin the Christmas switchover again.



If you have any other questions about Spring merchandise, feel free to leave feedback on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/shinodadesigncenter"">Facebook</a>.  That way others can see the answer and maybe they will find it helpful as well.



Hope this helps!"
history-of-valentines-day,"If you are within the United States, pretty much everyone knows that February 14th marks the annual Valentine's Day celebration.  Why do we celebrate it?  Where did it come from?  To answer these questions, I did some research and came up with the following.



Valentine's Day was established by Pope Gelasius in 496 AD.  It was named after several Saint Valentine Catholic martyrs.  The first of the martyrs was Valentine of Rome.  He was a priest in Rome martyred around 269 AD and is buried on the Via Flaminia.  The second was Valentine of Temi.  He was the bishop of Interamna (modern Temi) and was martyred around 197 AD following persecution by the Emperor Aurelian.  He is also buried in the Via Flaminia but in a different section from Valentine of Rome.  There is also reference to a third saint named Valentine.  Not much is known about him.  It was said he was martyred in Africa with several others.



It is interesting to note that romance was not linked to the day until the 14th century.  In 1400, a ""High Court of Love"" was established in Paris.  This link between romance and Valentine's Day would increase as Shakespeare and Chaucer would both write about the day.



During the 19th century, paper Valentine's became popular in England.  It became the practice to exchange handwritten notes.  The practice of exchanging handwritten notes evolved into commercial cards.  The celebration did not explode until the second half of the 20th century.  In the United States, the practice of exchanging handwritten notes and commercial cards extended into all manner of gifts including roses and chocolates.  It was not until the 1980's that the diamond industry began to promote Valentine's Day as a time to give jewelry.



How big has Valentine's Day become?  In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 1.3 billion pounds are annualy spent on cards, flowers, chocolates, jewelry, and other gifts.  An estimated 25 million cards are sent.  In the United States, it is estimated that over 1 billion Valentine cards are handed out.  In 2010, there were an estimated 15 million e-cards sent.



In 1969, one last interesting tidbit happened that would not deter the celebration of Valentine's Day.  Pope Paul VI deleted it from the General Roman Calendar of saints.  He stated, ""Though the memorial of Saint Valentine is ancient, it is left to particular calendars, since, apart from his name, nothing is known of Saint Valentine except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14.""



Let us know what you think.  Feel free to comment on our Facebook page and give your Valentine's Day opinions.

We are pleased to announce that Anthony Alvarez AIFD, CCF will be one of our featured floral designers at our 2012 Santa Ana Spring Floral Design Show.  Having previously been showcased at the 2011 San Diego Spring/Wedding Floral Design Show, we were overwhelmed by the audience reaction and feedback.  We thought the Santa Ana audience should be given the pleasure to see his work.  Anthony's bio follows:



Anthony is an avowed design junkie, frequently taking inspirations for his floral creations from fashion, sculpture, painting and his favorite architecture. Tony, as he is known to his friends has a formal education from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in Ornamental Horticulture. He brings this training and nearly thirty years of experience working in many facets of the floral industry to work every day. Tony has a teaching credential from the Ikenobo School of Ikebana and credits this art form with his ability to reduce a design to its essence with respect to negative space, line and focal emphasis.



Tony and his wife Debbie Alvarez AIFD are co-owners of a successful wedding event business called Floral Phenomenon based in Ventura, California. Tony also serves on the board of directors for the California State Floral Association and is a past president and educator for the group. He is a founding member of the California Certified Florist (CCF) program which seeks to educate florists in design basics and nomenclature and is one of the first organizations to be recognized as an accredited educational pathway provider for AIFD candidates. Tony is passionate about design education and is a proud member of the 358 Design team based in Vancouver, BC. Members of this talented international group routinely present design programs and create memorable floral events all over North America."

We are pleased to announce that Ben Lucero will be the featured floral designer at our 2012 San Diego Spring/Wedding Floral Design Show.  Following is his bio:



Ben is a seventeen year veteran of the floral industry.  In 2004, he started traveling nationwide, designing for major five star hotels and their special events.  In that same year, the Ahwatukee Hills newspaper, located in Arizona, nominated Ben for the Floral Designer of the Year award.  As team lead for a large event company, Ben played a key role in the design and install of the holiday décor for many luxury hotels located in Phoenix and the surrounding area including the JW Marriott Desert Ridge, the Phoenician and the Boulders Hotel, for several years running. Ben continues to play a role in the design of holiday décor for luxury hotels in the San Diego metro area including many private residences.



After having worked in the event industry for eight years, Ben was invited to design a custom floral for each of the performing artists dressing rooms at the 2009 Grammy Awards.   While living in Las Vegas, NV, Ben was fortunate to design for many of Las Vegas lavish celebrity parties including the Hard Rocks Casinos New Years Eve Bash in The Joint and during the summer months  for Rehab, also at the Hard Rock Casino.  As part of the floral design team, Ben played a key role in designing for Playboys Playmate of the Year Awards in 2009 for the Palms Hotel and Casino.



Ben moved to Albuquerque, NM in 2010.  That fall he entered in the floriculture design competition at the New Mexico State Fair and went on to win nineteen ribbons, seven of which were first place blue ribbons, and the 2010 New Mexico State Fair Design Sweepstakes Award.  Ben has brought his creativity to southern California and is a current resident of Oceanside, CA.  He hopes to give inspiration to other artists with his design, like others in the past have given him."

a-legacy-in-the-floral-industry,"As a family, we are very proud of our legacy of leadership in the industry.  We have proudly served and remained in the industry for over a hundred years now.  Over that span of time, five generations of family have grown up and worked in the floral industry.  The most prominent industry figure was Joseph Shinoda and his name may be familiar to many of you.  Today, we honor him through contributions to the Joseph Shinoda Memorial Scholarship Foundation.  If you have attended our floral design shows, you may have seen the signs soliciting donations.  You can see the fact sheet of the foundation's scholarship efforts on their website at <a href=""http://www.shinodascholarship.org/factSheet.htm"">www.shinodascholarship.org</a>.  More facts can be found in <a href=""http://www.shinodascholarship.org/Hist.html"">here</a>.

The financial adviser showed a fascinating graph that showed the relationship between unemployment rates and a person's education level.  I would not ordinarily include something like this on our blog.  However, as a parent that preaches the value of a college education to a teenage daughter, I thought this would be an invaluable tool to other parents in a similar situation!



The graph shows the rates spread over the last twenty years.

If you have spent any time at the Los Angeles Flower Market or the Carlsbad Floral Trade Center, chances are you have frequented the Mellano & Company booths.  You might have used their products as well since they grow a variety of products in their fields.



Sadly, I have to announce the passing of Johnny Mellano this past Sunday.  He was surrounded by his children, grandchildren, and friends.



From the Shinoda family and our staff, we pass on our condolences during this sad time and if you frequent a Mellano & Company location, take a moment and pass on your condolences to the family."

We have reached that time of year again.  The 2012 San Diego County Fair has opened and will run through the Fourth of July.  That means the 3rd annual San Diego County Fair Floral Design Competition as well!  For those of you that have never been before, you might ask, ""What is a floral design competition?""



A typical floral design competition consists of two rounds. The first is the designer's choice round. During this round, the floral designer must complete an arrangment consisting of fresh flowers and supplies that they have chosen. There are usually limits on what types of flowers and supplies used. The finished arrangement must also fit into a stated theme. The fun is only starting as they move into round two the ""Surprise Package"". For the ""Surprise Package"" round, the designer's are all given the same flowers and supplies. Under the pressure of a running clock, they must complete an arrangement that fits within the stated theme of the round. This is when you see how truly creative designers can be. I've always found it remarkable how different the arrangements can be even though the designers are forced to use the exact same materials. So, if you've never watched a floral design competition, this is something that I would definitely recommend.

groomsmen-gift-bags,"For my wedding earlier this month, I had 8 groomsmen.  I wanted to get them all something for taking the time to come out for our wedding, which I greatly appreciated.  I hadn't really given any thought to how we might present them.  Luckily my wife was on top of that.  She put together these gift bags, which were suitably masculine and a great improvement over just handing them some things.

[caption id=""attachment_3659"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""540"" caption=""Black jute garland used for gift wrap on my groomsmen&#039;s gifts""]<img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_20120526_203335-764x1024.jpg"" alt=""Black jute garland used as gift wrap"" title=""black-jute-garland-gift-wrap"" width=""540"" height=""857"" class=""size-large wp-image-3659"" />[/caption]



We used a <a href=""/14-black-jute-garland-10yd/3275/"" title=""jute garland"" target=""_blank"">jute garland</a> to wrap the gifts, and then tied it with some <a href=""/1-4-wraphia-ii-kraft-100yd/3028/"" title=""raffia"" target=""_blank"">raffia</a>.  Turned out to be a perfect touch for the gifts that didn't require too much time (or expense!).  Here's a picture of several of them in a basket, which we used to transport them.

We were really pleased with how it turned out: something that added to the presentation without being overly ornate.  If your next bride is looking for something for the groomsmen or her father, or if you're looking for a simple presentation for gift baskets or party favors, try something like this.  One roll of the jute garland was enough to wrap all eight of our gifts.

Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending the 2012 San Diego County Fair Floral Design Competition.  After attending all three iterations of this design competition and at least a dozen other competitions, I was surprised to see a standing room only headcount.  It was very well attended.



I will be writing this up in more detail when I get the official pictures.  By the way, if you were at the event, George Speer, who runs the event, handed me the camera and made me the official photographer.  If you were there, I was the one constantly moving around tIf I kept making you move or got in your way, sorry for that!



Results:



1st Place - Sonja Longley

2nd Place - Karyn Wlocewski (also won People's Choice)

3rd Place - Karen Kroemer-Spiess



Congratulations to these talented ladies!

floralife-research-update-prolong-the-life-of-cut-hydrangeas,"August 2012

Floralife, a division of Smithers-Oasis Company

Oasis® Maxlife Combined with Floralife® Flower Food Clear 300 Prolongs the life of cut hydrangea



Background

Few cut flowers provide a greater visual impact than Hydrangeas, contrasting a large but delicate floral display with lush green foliage. Unfortunately, the large number of individual flowers, high foliage surface area, and thick woody stems make them an easy target for premature wilting. Cut Hydrangeas have a reputation of lasting only a few days in a vase or floral foam arrangements when using plain water particularly if adequate hydration is not maintained. 



Our previous studies have shown that OASIS® Floral Foam Maxlife prolongs the life of Gerbera Daisy, another cut flower with a poor reputation in foam arrangements due to challenges with hydration. Based on these results we wanted to evaluate the performance of cut Hydrangeas in OASIS® Floral Foam Maxlife. In addition, we wanted to see how the Hydrangeas performed in OASIS® Floral Foam Maxlife soaked in plain water vs. how it performed soaked in a solution of Floralife® Flower Food Clear 300.



Methods

1. White Hydrangeas were received from a local wholesaler.

2. All stems were recut on arrival and placed in tap water (60 ppm alkalinity) in the flower cooler (2 degrees C) for 24 hours. 

3. For the foam treatment, OASIS® Floral Foam Maxlife bricks were soaked in either:

a. Plain tap water (120 ppm alkalinity) 

b. A solution made with Floralife® Flower Food Clear 300 

(note: Both foams were placed in design trays)

4. All stems were recut and inserted to a depth of 6 to 7 cm in the foam brick. 

5. Design tray reservoirs were filled with the treatment soak solutions at the beginning of the study, but no additional solution was added for the remainder of the test. 

6. For vase treatments, we prepared:

a. A vase with 500 ml of plain water.

b. A vase with 1 L properly dosed solution of Flower Food 300 and water.

7. Flower stems were recut and immediately placed in vase solutions. Additional solution was added to maintain the 500 ml volume throughout the test. 

8. Vase and foam treatments were placed on tables in the postharvest lab in a completely randomized design (12 hours of fluorescent lighting at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C). 

9. Flower life (in days) was determined subjectively when wilting was clearly visible. 

10. Each foam and vase treatment was repeated 3 times with each repetition containing 3 stems.

11. Flower life averages were determined for each treatment and analyzed using Statistica Software to determine statistical significance.



Results and Discussion

Floralife® Flower Food Clear 300 significantly increased flower life in the vase and OASIS® Floral Foam Maxlife treatments. Results indicate that cut Hydrangeas are very responsive to flower food and it is speculated that the Maxlife technology helps facilitate the uptake of flower food in the floral foam arrangement. This study demonstrates that cut Hydrangeas can last an average of 8 days in a floral foam arrangement when combining OASIS® Floral Foam Maxlife and Floralife® Flower Food Clear 300 technologies.



<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/2012/08/31/floralife-research-update-prolong-the-life-of-cut-hydrangeas/maxlife_clear300_chart_8-12/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-3829""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Maxlife_Clear300_Chart_8.12-300x223.jpg"" alt="""" title=""Maxlife_Clear300_Chart_8.12"" width=""300"" height=""223"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3829"" /></a>



Conclusion

OASIS® Floral Foam Maxlife saturated in Floralife® Flower Food Clear 300 resulted in an average flower life of 8 days compared to only 4.5 days in Maxlife + plain tap water. The Maxlife + Flower Food Clear 300 treatment performed as well statistically with flower food in a vase even though no additional water was added to the foam treatments. 

Note: For best results on getting fully saturated foam, always place foam in the soaking solution broad side down with the imprinted logo on the top surface. This is because the foam cell structure is such that it soaks best from the bottom up.

We are pleased to announce that Tony and Debbie Alvarez AIFD, CCF will be our featured designers at our 2012 San Diego Christmas Floral Design Show.  Their bio follows:



About the Floral Phenomenon Family:



     Husband and wife design team Tony and Debbie Alvarez AIFD, CCF, met while working on a degree in Ornamental Horticulture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  Their love of floral design and floriculture led them to start their own retail flower shop after graduation.  In business for over 18 years they decided that they would specialize in their favorite aspect of the event industry and Floral Phenomenon was born. With an emphasis on party and wedding work Debbie and Tony create memorable floral events for the bride as well as corporate clients.  



    With their years of experience in floristry and background in Ornamental Horticulture this team brings their combined skills to every design challenge.  Both are members of the American Institute of Floral Design (AIFD) and have degrees in the Ikenobo School of Ikebana and are California Certified Florists (CCF) as well as members of the prestigious international group, Design 35 8 based in Vancouver, BC. This dynamic duo are frequent instructors for design programs and workshops sponsored by the California State Floral Association and love to share their talent with the novice as well as seasoned professional floral designer.  



     Tony and Debbie are strong proponents of working as green as possible.  They recycle all cardboard, plastics and paper waste and use glass that can be reused or in many cases rented for an event.  All water used in flower hydrating buckets is recycled to the landscape and use of petroleum based products is reduced in all phases of the creative process.  Flowers are purchased from organic growers where possible and farms that adhere to eco friendly growing techniques.

tip-of-the-day-how-many-lights-should-i-purchase-for-my-christmas-tree-2,"Last year, we ran a series of Tip of the Day articles.  Since so many of the questions are coming up again, I thought I would re-post some of the tips from last year.  So, if this looks familiar, it should.  This was originally posted on 9/1/2011.



<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/24-mini-tree-w-wood-base/3154/""><img src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4629475028-300x300.jpg"" alt=""24&quot; Mini Christmas Tree"" title=""24&quot; Mini Christmas Tree"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1131"" /></a>



First, let me say that there is no exact number for the lights that should go on a Christmas tree.  This is due to the variability in how bright someone wants the tree, how closely or far apart they want the differing level of lights to be, how tightly or loosely they place the strands, and the type of tree itself.



The following recommendations are very loose places to start and are  generalized for the average Christmas tree.



<table align=""center"" border=""0"" width=""250"">

Today, when I started to think about the Tip of the Day, my brain was not working right and I could not think of anything. So, I called the Santa Ana warehouse for suggestions. The first question that I was asked was, ""How much ribbon do you need to decorate a Christmas tree?"" I have been asked this many times before and my mental logjam was broken.



This was not an easy answer to come by. Most companies and most designers will tell you that the number can be very different. It all depends on how tightly or loosely you wrap the ribbon and how much spacing you put between the wraps. The number can vary quite widely. The answer came from moving to a different product. I found some recommendations for the amount of Christmas garland decorations to place on a Christmas Tree. These are the general recommendations of where to start:

<table width=""250"" border=""0"" align=""center"">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td align=""center"">Tree Height</td>

<td align=""center"">Amount of Ribbon</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>4' - 5'</td>

<td>40 feet - 55 feet</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>6' - 6.5'</td>

<td>70 feet - 75 feet</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>7' - 7.5'</td>

<td>84 feet - 98 feet</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>8' - 9'</td>

<td>120 feet - 150 feet</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

Remember, these are generalized suggestions. You can use these as a guide on how much ribbon to start with. These guides also apply to fabric or netting used as garland in a tree.

Since we have moved into November, many of the upcoming Tips of the Day will involve Christmas. Today's tip is one of the most fundamental to decorating for Christmas. How many ornaments do you need to purchase to decorate your Christmas tree? As a general guide, there are two rules to follow. For a tree up to nine feet, use ten ornaments per foot. If the tree is over nine feet, use between twelve to sixteen ornaments per foot. In a table, it would look like this:

<table width=""250"" border=""0"" align=""center"">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td align=""center"">Tree Height</td>

<td align=""center"">Number of Ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>5'</td>

<td>50 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>6'</td>

<td>60 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>7'</td>

<td>70 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>8'</td>

<td>80 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>9'</td>

<td>90 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>10'</td>

<td>120 - 160 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>12'</td>

<td>144 - 192 ornaments</td>

</tr>

<tr align=""center"">

<td>14'</td>

<td>168 - 224 ornaments</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

Remember, these are general guidelines on where to start. Depending on the size of the ornaments selected and the desired density of the placement, this could vary by a great deal.

Walking around the warehouse the other day, a customer stopped me.  She pointed to a Christmas tree and asked me, ""How do I add snow flocking to something?""



A light went off in my head saying, ""This would make an excellent Tip of the Day!""



I walked her to our spray paint section and pointed out a can that said Holiday Snow Premium Snow Flock.  This is the product you use to add snow flocking to.

""How many yards of ribbon do I need to purchase to make 10 bows?""



That is a question I have heard a multitude of times in the warehouse.  There really is not a good objective answer for it since it will involve the number of bow loops involved, the length you will make each loop, the number of tails you will be running off the bow, and the length of those tails.  I can give you a general guideline with a bow built with our description.

When <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/christmas/"">Christmas</a> and <a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/seasonal/thanksgiving-fall/"">Thanksgiving</a> arrive, we sell a lot of taper candles.  With heights ranging from 6"" to 24"" and a wide color assortment, for two months of the year, it becomes a major category.  The one question I have gotten countless times is, ""How long will this burn for?""



The answer is simple.  The taper candle rule of thumb is burn time will be approximately one hour per inch of candle.  So, a 12"" taper will burn for approximately 12 hours.  There are many factors that can affect candle burn time such as elevation, air temperature, and humidity.  However, this does work well as a general guideline.

During the last couple of weeks, I have had several conversations with customers about the height of the Christmas tree they should buy.  They have measured out the height of the ceiling and are trying to pick out a tree that will fill the area.  The first question I ask is always, ""How tall of a tree topper do you plan to put on your tree?""



Tree toppers are often considered the heart and soul of Christmas Tree decoration because many people feel they define the tree.  When putting on a tree topper, usually they are tall.  Plus, as the tree gets taller, the tree topper generally does as well to maintain a ratio of tree topper to tree height.  When deciding on how tall a tree the ceiling will allow, many people overlook the added height of the tree topper.  The other day, a customer told me her ceiling was 12'3"".  She asked if a 12' tree would fit.  I told her that it would but not if she planned on using a tree topper.  She had completely forgotten that her tree topper was 10"" high and wouldn't fit under her ceiling.  She ended up buying a 10' Christmas tree instead.

silk-flower-factory-in-china-pictures,"Our import buyer recently took a trip overseas to start purchasing for the Christmas 2013 season.  One of the stops was a silk flower factory.  If you've ever wondered how a silk flower is made, here's an example.



Materials start in one room where they are cut into the shapes of flower petals and leaves.  Next, they are transported to the room where the petals and leaves are hand painted for production.  They are then sent into a room where they are pressed into their form.  In this room, they put the leaves onto a molding machine one at a time, close the mold, and inject hot liquid plastic to form the stem of the petals and flowers.  They are then moved to another room for assembly of the flower petals and calyx.  The finished flower head is then attached to the stem.  Finally, they enter the last area where they are boxed and cased for shipment.



Most people do not realize how much work and labor goes into the assembly of each artificial flower.  With modern factory techniques, it is often assumed that the work is done by machinery.  Modern machinery has a difficult time producing the detail of hand painting for the current selling price of aritifical flowers.  So the next time you are in the warehouse and walk down our rows of silk flowers, you will have a better appreciation of how much work went into their creation.

joseph-shinoda-memorial-scholarship-foundation-now-receiving-2013-2014-scholarship-applications,"San Luis Obispo, Calif.  Shinoda Foundation Scholarship applications are now being received for future growers, retailers, florists, and horticulturists.



   ""For college and university students planning careers in floriculture, the Shinoda scholarships present an enviable opportunity for advancement,"" says Paul Ecke III, president of the Joseph Shinoda Memorial Scholarship Foundation. ""Through them our industry invests in the future, sowing the seeds for a lifetime of success.""



   The Shinoda Foundation Scholarships, including the prestigious Shinoda Scholar of the Year, are bestowed annually. Two additional scholarships honor top floral design students: the Shinoda Design Center Scholarship and the Jimmy Shinoda Memorial Scholarship, which support California community colleges in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego counties.



   To be considered for any of these awards, students must complete and return the application by March 30, 2013. Winners will be announced by the Shinoda Foundation later in the spring.



   Winners of the scholarships, named in honor of California floral industry pioneer Joseph Shinoda, have gone on to become leaders in floriculture. Among the former beneficiaries are Andy Higgins, president of Ecke Ranch, Encinitas, Calif., and Royal D. Heins, horticulture professor emeritus at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Mich.



   The foundation has assisted more than 600 students with a total of more than $740,000 since Richard Tsukushi of Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, and George Field of University of California, Davis, received the first Shinoda Scholarships in 1965.



   Undergraduates in accredited colleges, universities, and California community colleges are eligible. Preference will be given to applicants who have indicated a strong commitment of furthering their education in the field of floriculture (production, research, retail, floral education, floral design, and sales and marketing).

  Find downloadable forms and detailed information on the 2013-2014 scholarships at <a href=""http://www.shinodascholarship.org/index.html"">www.shinodascholarship.org</a>. Beginning in mid-January, information will also be available from horticulture department offices at colleges and universities across the nation.



Information about making contributions to the foundation or about its scholarship program can be obtained from its website <a href=""http://www.shinodascholarship.org/index.html"">www.shinodascholarship.org</a>."

""With these awards we honor horticulture's best and brightest,"" said Paul Ecke III, president of the Shinoda Foundation. ""We know as they grow, the industry will grow with themand that's an immeasurable investment.""



The Shinoda Foundation Board of Trustees awarded 11 scholarships this year totaling $19,500. In addition, to further advance horticulture education nationwide, the Foundation sends a portion of the awards to educational institutions. Winners' academic departments receive 10% of the awards to students in their department. This year's college and university awards total $1,950, bringing the total distribution to $21,450.



The Foundation selects its recipients based on rigorous criteria including career goals, academics, work experience, extracurricular activities and need.

Incorporated as a separate entity in 1972, the foundation has awarded scholarships valued at more than $760,000 to nearly 650 undergraduate floriculture students since 1965.

<strong>Anthony Alvarez, AIFD, CCF</strong>



Anthony is an avowed design junkie, frequently taking inspirations for his floral creations from fashion, sculpture, painting and his favorite architecture.  Tony, as he is known to his friends has a formal education from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in Ornamental Horticulture.  He brings this training and nearly thirty years of experience working in many facets of the floral industry to work every day.  Tony has a teaching credential from the Ikenobo School of Ikebana and credits this art form with his ability to reduce a design to its essence with respect to negative space, line and focal emphasis.



Tony and his wife Debbie Alvarez AIFD are co-owners of a successful wedding event business called Floral Phenomenon based in Ventura, California.  Tony also serves on the board of directors for the California State Floral Association and is a past president and educator for the group.  He is a founding member of the California Certified Florist (CCF) program which seeks to educate florists in design basics and nomenclature and is one of the first organizations to be recognized as an accredited educational pathway provider for AIFD candidates.   Tony is passionate about design education and is a proud member of the 358 Design team based in Vancouver, BC.  Members of this talented international group routinely present design programs and create memorable floral events all over North America.



<strong>Matt Wood, AIFD</strong>



Born and raised in a small town in Mississippi, Matt Wood, AFID has long been inspired by the lush natural scenery and rich graceful heritage of Americas Southern states.  He is particularly moved by the seasons of the year, which mark not only the glorious changes in the physical world but moments of our lives as well.  To talk with Matt, one soon learns that his personal mission has long been to bring the field of permanent botanical into a new light. For individuals to see them as another way to express a love of the flora and fauna that surround each of us.



Matt is an exceptional designer, his incredible sense of color and texture, combined with his ability to breathe life into the same permanent botanicals he spends so much of his time creating in factories around the world is simply unparallel When designing, he gently turns the flowers head to face the light source and flexes the leaves as if they have just received a long, cool drink of fresh water.  All these special touches result in floral designs that may fool even the most avid of gardeners.



Matt is Creative Director for Winward International, the premiere manufacturer and distributor of handmade permanent botanicals and seasonal décor and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<a href=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ben-Lucero-show-designer-bio-photo-pic-0913.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5815"" title=""Ben Lucero show designer bio photo pic 0913"" src=""http://www.shinodadesigncenter.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ben-Lucero-show-designer-bio-photo-pic-0913-300x277.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""277"" /></a>



Ben is a seventeen year veteran of the floral industry.  Ben started traveling nationwide, designing for major five star hotels and their special events in 2004.  In that same year, the Ahwatukee Hills newspaper located in Arizona nominated Ben for the Floral Designer of the Year award.  As team lead for a large event company, Ben played a key role in the design and install of the holiday décor for many luxury hotels located in the Phoenix surrounding area including the JW Marriott Desert Ridge, the Phoenician and the Boulders Hotel, for several years running. Ben continues to play a role in the design of holiday décor for luxury hotels in the San Diego metro area including many private residences.



After having worked in the event industry for eight years, Ben was invited to design a custom floral for each of the performing artists dressing rooms at the 2009 Grammy Awards.   While living in Las Vegas, NV, Ben was fortunate to design for many of Las Vegas lavish celebrity parties including the Hard Rock Casinos New Years Eve Bash in The Joint and during the summer months  for Rehab, also at the Hard Rock Casino.  As part of the floral design team, Ben played a key role in designing for Playboys Playmate of the Year Awards in 2009 for the Palms Hotel and Casino.



Ben moved to Albuquerque, NM in 2010.  That fall he entered in the floriculture design competition at the New Mexico State Fair and went on to win nineteen ribbons, seven of which were first place blue ribbons, and the 2010 New Mexico State Fair Design Sweepstakes Award.  Ben has brought his creativity to southern California and is a current resident of Oceanside, CA.  He hopes to give inspiration to other artists like himself with his design, like others in the past have given him.

complete-list-of-tip-of-the-day-blogs,"We ran a series of blogs called ""Tip of the Day"" a couple of years back.  I re-ran some of the tips during this last Christmas season.  For customers and readers that have never seen them before, I decided to compile a complete list of them.  I had forgotten how many that I wrote and it took a bit longer then I expected it to.  In order to make it easier to read, I broke the tips into subcategories.



I would like to start ""Tip of the Day"" up again.  Feel free to ask as a Facebook comment, add a comment on this blog, or email me directly at jameks@shinodadesigncenter.net.

Monday, January 6, 2014

12:30 pm

Hosted At:  Shinoda Design Center (San Diego Warehouse)

7170 Miramar Rd

San Diego,CA

Floral Design Program

<strong>Sponsored By:  Palomar Districts Floral Design Forum</strong>

Cost:  $12 for NGC members, and $15 for guests

<strong><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/pdclubs/projects-programs/floral-design-forum"">For More Information Click Here.</a></strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Not every flower arranger knows what armatures are. Too bad. Armatures should be in every floral designer's bag of tricks. Sandi Lord, Master Flower Show Judge and long-time avid competitor in local flower shows and the San Diego County Fair, is going to show you how to make the most of them at this next Floral Design Forum. From commercially available products to easy things you can make or do, armatures are a fun thing.  Whether you are a professional florist, an amateur arranger, or a dedicated NGC designer, you will learn some new things that you can use in working with flowers that will make your designs have more impact and save you time and money. In addition, Sandi will be talking about and demonstrating the new NGC Armature Form Design. There will be lots of design photos to see, as well. It will be a fun and educational time for all.</p>
